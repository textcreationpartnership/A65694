            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is but juſtice I ſhould give to your Honour ſome account of my publiſhing theſe Sermons to the world, and making bold to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them under the protection of your Name.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Age wherein we live, which ſeems to have a fulſom loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch <hi>Manna;</hi> Yet I muſt confeſs, I was ſtrongly inclined
<pb facs="tcp:46197:3"/>thereunto, by the due reſpects I bear to the memory of my dear deceaſed Husband; and was willing the world ſhould have ſome laſting taſts of his worth, which through Gods goodneſs I had the happineſs for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years to enjoy. Beſides a mournful Widow, he left divers worthy Friends, who (to feed their reflecting thoughts) deſired ſome uſeful (and innocent) Relique of him, whom living, they ſo much lov'd and honour'd; and dying, ſo lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If I was overcome by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of ſuch as I might well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count wiſer than my ſelf; though the action ſhould ſeem to be in ſome ſort inconvenient, yet I hope with all ingenuous perſons, the weakneſs
<pb facs="tcp:46197:3"/>of my Sex, and ſtrength of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will become my juſt Apology. They are indeed offered in a homely dreſs of words, and deprived of that poliſhing which my dear Husband could well have beſtowed upon them; and doubtleſs would have done, had be thought they ſhould have been thus expoſed. They are (for the moſt part) as they drop'd (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out curioſity) from his mouth, and were taken by the pen of an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate friend. Nor would a ſcrupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity which I had, permit they ſhould be ſo altered (though for the better) as that they might not be wholly call'd <hi>his own.</hi> Yet muſt I not here diſſemble, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of better judgments than
<pb facs="tcp:46197:4"/>mine, your Honours encouragement and approbation, made me apt to believe theſe Sermons (even as they are) might be both accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all that knew him, and in ſome degree ſerviceable to the Souls of others, who ſhould pleaſe to read them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons I think ſufficient to mention as inducements to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>lication: Which when I had once reſolv'd upon, I was held in no ſuſpence to whoſe Patronage to commit them.</p>
            <p>Your Honour hath ſo many Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to them, that it had been a kind of robbing, to alienate or transfer your right to any other perſon. They are Sermons; and therefore they
<pb facs="tcp:46197:4"/>ought to be your Honours. If any underſtand not the force of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, they want Eyes to behold the moſt eminent Example of true Virtue and Piety. I can fear no imputation of <hi>flattery,</hi> while I mention your known and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worth, which preſcribes to thoſe of your high Degree things truly <hi>great,</hi> and becoming that Noble Blood that runs in your Veins. You are one (and where's the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?) that dares be ſo viſibly good, in an Age wherein Virtue is almoſt ſcandalous, and Godlineſs is matter of ſport to the froth and ſmaller Wits of the Town: You therefore (doubtleſs) will favour and own what others will ſcorn and diſdain.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46197:5"/>
            <p>Add to this (Madam) as a ſpecial ground of this Dedication, That conſtant and ſingular favour which your Honour hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reflect, firſt, upon my ever ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Father-in-Law, Mr. <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Whitaker,</hi> whoſe Name is ſtill precious, as of a man for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, learning, and prudence, famous in his generation: Then upon his Son, my dear Husband, who hath alſo left ſuch impreſſions on his friends, as I hope will not ſoon be defaced; and ſince his death, upon my most unworthy ſelf: ſo that you have not left off to ſhew kindneſs both to the living and to the dead.</p>
            <p>The laſt (though not the leaſt) motive is, That ſome of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb facs="tcp:46197:5"/>were preached in obedience to your Commands (for ſuch were your Honours deſires always to my dear Husband), And as they <hi>then</hi> were, ſo I doubt not but they <hi>now</hi> will be therefore the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Some one, or all of theſe Reaſons (however they may acquit me of indiſcretion, yet) I hope will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure at leaſt a pardon for the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of,</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THou art here preſented with ſome <hi>Sermons</hi> preached by that ſolid and judicious Divine Mr. <hi>William Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker:</hi> Whom the Supreme and Soveraign Diſpoſer (in whoſe hands are the life, breath, and time of all men) a few months ſince was pleaſed to take to himſelf. After which dark and very afflictive Providence, his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Relict, and ſome faithful Friends, made it their buſineſs to ſingle out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons which in the courſe of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry he had preached, ſome few which they ſhould judg moſt fit for the Preſs, and them to publiſh to the world. What progreſs they have made in this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking (as full of zeal towards the living, as of affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:46197:7"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46197:7"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46197:8"/>the dead), thou wilt ſee by that which is here expoſed to thy view: 'Tis by this means that theſe Sermons are brought to light; concerning which I do ſtedfaſtly hope, that as they who have promoted the printing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will have no cauſe to repent of the pains they have taken in the collecting and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; ſo, that they who ſhall buy and read them, will have no cauſe to repent either of the coſt they ſhall be at in buying, or of the time they ſhall ſpend in the peruſing of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſad, very ſad, that ſo good a Man, ſo uſeful a Miniſter, in the midſt of his days, maturity of judgment, ripeneſs of parts, heigth of ſerviceableneſs, ſhould ſo ſuddenly be ſnatcht away from us; but the Lord hath done it, in whoſe Will it becomes us to acquieſce. And we have this to alleviate the ſadneſs of this diſpenſation, though he be dead, all is not dead with him; his perſon (to our great grief) is gone, but (to our great comfort) ſome of his profitable labours are left behind. 'Tis too true, the having a few <hi>ſelect Sermons</hi> will not countervail the loſs of <hi>himſelf;</hi> but things being as they are, we muſt make the beſt of what we have, when we cannot have what we would. When we cannot enjoy <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> we muſt be glad of any thing that was <hi>his;</hi> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> was glad, though he had but
<pb facs="tcp:46197:8"/>the Mantle of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that dropt from him when he aſcended to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> The great thing deſign'd in the publication of theſe Diſcourſes, being the promoting of thy good, thou canſt not but apprehend thy ſelf the more ſtrongly obliged, to receive them with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and to peruſe them with all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs. Do not miſtake thy ſelf in any fond imagination, that the thing mainly aimed at in this work is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating of the Name and Memory of the Author deceaſed, (though 'tis pity that ſhould ever be forgotten), or the making of his choice abilities ſomewhat more publickly known to the world, (though 'tis pity too they ſhould not better be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood): No, (ſo far as I can judg of the ends of others), I think I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aver, that the furtherers thereof had higher things in their eye; <hi>viz.</hi> the advancing of Gods Honour, and (next to that) of the ſpiritual and eternal good of immortal Souls. Which if ſo, then ſurely as thou art greatly indebted to them for their ſingular love, ſo thou ſhouldſt be very earneſt with the Lord in prayer that theſe great ends may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46197:9"/>
            <p>We know too well, by variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, what a diſadvantage it is to the labours of godly Miniſters, when they are put forth after their death, by others, and not by themſelves: For, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, they often want the Authors own laſt hand in the perfecting and poliſhing of them; and (beſides) the world is the more apt to queſtion, whether they be natural and genuine. Now as to the firſt of theſe inconveniencies I can ſay nothing, (I not having had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of peruſing theſe Sermons), and therefore can be no competent Judg, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do or do not lie under that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But as to the later, I can aſſure all who may deſire ſatisfaction therein, here is nothing but what is the genuine iſſue of the Author himſelf: The word is <hi>poſthumous,</hi> but not in the leaſt <hi>ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi> Theſe Sermons were taken from his own mouth, by a very exact and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Noter; and ſo printed without any conſiderable alteration (as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed). And I do not doubt, but that ſuch who knew the Father, will find ſo much of his image in the whole work, as that they will preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be his very Child.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46197:9"/>
            <p>I muſt not commend what I have not ſeen: Yet though I may not commend the Preacher from the Sermons, I may commend the Sermons from the Preacher. He therefore being one who knew much of the Myſteries of the Goſpel, that had a large ſtock of knowledg, Humane and Divine; that was an <hi>able Miniſter of the New Teſtament,</hi> a <hi>Workman that needed not to be aſhamed:</hi> I ſay, he being ſuch a perſon, I may well preſume what was done by him to be well done, and that much good may be expected thereby;<note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 8.21.</note> 
               <hi>as was the man, ſo was his ſtrength.</hi> And I am very confident, that none who concur with me in theſe apprehenſions, will meet with any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
            <p>Reader, I'le ſay no more of what is here done, I wholly commit it to Gods bleſſing and thy Chriſtian candour: But as to the Author, how much could I ſay! What a large <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> without any falſhood or partiality, might I make of him! how eager is my Pen to run out in giving the world a <hi>full Narrative</hi> of his ſingular worth and excellent endowments! But I muſt keep it in; conſidering, I am writing but a compendicus Preface, which will not admit of ſo large a Subject.
<pb facs="tcp:46197:10"/>'Twould be an injury to the living (though none to the dead), if ſuch an one as our departed Friend ſhould not be drawn at his full length (and I hope I ſhall find that done by ſome other hand); I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with a ſhorter draught of him, only to ſhadow out ſome of his moſt lovely features and lineaments, without filling of them up: My hearty Affections commands me to do ſo much, the ſtrict bounds of a Preface will permit me to do no more.</p>
            <p>And where ſhall we take a view of this excellent perſon and not have ſomething in our eye praiſe-worthy and commendable? View him as a <hi>Man,</hi> he was of a moſt ſweet diſpoſition, a moſt ingenuous temper, a moſt obliging, affable, courteous, winning, deportment, and made up of love; all honey, no gall; who ever either did or could charge him with a ſowre, moroſe, ugly nature? And what an advantage is ſuch a temper and carriage to all! eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Ministers! 'tis pity that Grace and good Nature ſhould ever be parted; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter makes a little of the former go a great way, (as a little Sugar is enough to ſweeten the Wine that is not ſharp and rough): the one makes a perſon amiable to God; the other, to Men.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46197:10"/>
            <p>View him as a <hi>Scholar,</hi> he was a very learned Man; one richly accompliſhed in all parts of good literature. His skill in the ſeveral Languages, his inſight into all <hi>Philoſophy, Philology,</hi> &amp;c. but eſpecially into <hi>Theology,</hi> was ſuch, that if any ſhould attempt to diminiſh or diſparage his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they must give me leave to ſay of them, Either they did not know him, or elſe they do not know themſelves. His natural abilities were very good, which by ſtudy and industry he had highly improv'd: He was not one that lov'd to make a noiſe ('tis your ſhallow waters that uſe to do ſo); but he had well digested and mustered the most conſiderable parts of true Learning. And I am confident all will concur with me in this Character of him, who are not under a ſpirit of malevolence and detraction; of that naughty humour to engroſs all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to themſelves, and to leſſen the worth of thoſe (let them be who they will) who are not of their own way and party.</p>
            <p>View him as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he was ſincerely gracious and godly (which puts a greater beauty and luster upon him than all his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or acquired endowments whatſoever). He was another <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> without guile; another <hi>Jacob,</hi> of a plain ſpirit; one of a tender conſcience (of which ſome great
<pb facs="tcp:46197:11"/>turns in his life were a very ſignal demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration); one who made it his daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to keep <hi>a conſcience void of offence towards God and men.</hi> And ſurely ſuch who ſaw the blameleſneſs and holineſs of his life, could not but judg this of him, That he was a perſon truly fearing God. All the ſeveral graces of the Spirit were (more or leſs) auſpicious in him; but not any one more than Humility: O how eminent was he in this grace of graces! what a pattern was he thereof to all who obſerved him! He was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, high in Gifts, Parts, Grace, Service; low in nothing but only in his own thoughts. How meanly did he always ſpeak and think of himſelf? how highly of others, yea, of many who were much his inferiors! Did he uſe to exalt himſelf and depreſs others? no! in lowlineſs of mind he eſteemed them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himſelf (wherein I would to God we could all imitate him).</p>
            <p>View him as a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and (as ſuch) I think I may ſay of him, Not many did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize him, very few did excel him. He was a ſound, ſolid, profitable Preacher; and in all the other works of the Pastoral Office: as he was eminently fitted for it, ſo he was eminently faithful in the diſcharging of it. Should I particularize the ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:46197:11"/>
               <hi>Graces, Qualifications, Duties,</hi> which the Word ſets down concerning Miniſters, we ſhould find them all to be in, and done by our deceaſed Brother; and that too in a very great proportion. He was no loyterer in the Vineyard, but a diligent and painful labourer in the work of his great Lord and Maſter. He ſought not himſelf but the good of others: and I verily believe of him, there were but few amongſt his Brethren who were more above the temptations of vain-glory and filthy lucre, than he was. Great was his ſoundneſs in the Faith, he <hi>held faſt the faithful Word,</hi> and the <hi>form of ſound words;</hi> preach'd no <hi>other Goſpel</hi> than what Christ and the Apostles had preach'd before him; ſtarted no fond and novel Opinions, but kept to the <hi>Faith once delivered</hi> to the Saints. He was no <hi>corrupter of the Word of God; but as of ſincerity as of God, in the ſight of God ſpake he in Chriſt</hi> (as the great Apoſtle once ſaid of himſelf <hi>2 Cor. 2.17.</hi>); no <hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi> was by him laid upon the Foundation; nothing came from him but the <hi>ſincere milk</hi> of the Word. In his preaching the everlasting Goſpel he was no trifler; O how much was he above the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of word!</hi> 'twas not polite language, but ſolidity of matter which he minded; what might reach the conſcience rather than what
<pb facs="tcp:46197:12"/>might tickle the ear, or pleaſe the fancy, that was regarded by him. And as his Doctrine was without taint, ſo his Converſation was without ſtain or blemiſh; he <hi>preached well,</hi> and (which is much<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> in Actu A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. Hom. 30.</note> harder) he <hi>lived well</hi> too: as he taught others, ſo he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; there was an excellent harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Doctrine and his Practice; he <hi>holding forth the Word of life</hi> not only in the Pulpit, but in his whole courſe. His ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, towards weaker and dejected Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, his Prudence in counſelling, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, debating, ordering all his Ministerial concerns, his admirable conjoyning the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Serpent with the innocency of the Dove, his meekneſs and patience in bearing wrongs and unkindneſſes; with many other of his excellent properties, I must paſs over; leſt whilst I remember him, I ſhould forget my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Once more let us take a view of him in his <hi>Relations;</hi> whilst God continued his Parents, what a loving, obedient, dutiful <hi>Son</hi> was he! when they were taken away, how did he honour their memory, and (which was much higher) how did he in all things tread in their ſteps! He was indeed <hi>optimi patris optimi filius,</hi> an excellent Son of an excellent Father; where, as he ſucceeded in the place of his Miniſtry, ſo alſo in his Graces.
<pb facs="tcp:46197:12"/>And (which in theſe times is as a thing ſomewhat rare) he kept to the last that tincture which he had first received in his pious education. What a tender and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate <hi>Husband</hi> he was, the daily tears, deep ſorrow of his diſconſolate Widow do abundantly testifie: and for the rest of his ſurviving Relations, who of them do not greatly lament his death! he was a prudent, faithful, hearty <hi>Friend,</hi> and he was in my loſs (amongſt many others). Who had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experience of the truth and valuable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his friendſhip than my ſelf? which doth very much heighten my grief for the loſs of him. But this year hath prov'd fatal to me, it having pleaſed God therein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move two of the trueſt, ancientest Friends I had in the world; this in the Ministry for one, and<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> William Sommers <hi>Merchant in</hi> London.</note> one of the Laity for another.</p>
            <p>And was he ſuch a perſon, in all theſe reſpects ſo amiable, ſo accompliſhed? what cauſe have we then with all ſeriouſneſs to reſent that ſad Providence which hath made ſuch a breach upon us! How much have we lost in one <hi>Whittaker!</hi> and ſhall we not be ſenſible of our loſs? yet withall, how ſhould we bleſs the Lord that ever we had him, and that we enjoy'd him ſo long! that though he be gone, yet we have here left behind
<pb facs="tcp:46197:13"/>ſomething of him. And (chiefly) how ſhould we endeavour to write after that fair Copy which he hath ſet us! to follow him who was ſuch a follower of Christ! He lived Christ, and therefore to him death was gain. The good Lord grant we may all <hi>ſo live</hi> and <hi>ſo die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, I'll detain thee no longer; only pray, That all the Helps afforded to thee by the living, by the dead, may be bleſſed to the furtherance of thy ſalvation through the ſupplies of the Spirit. I am (whileſt I am)</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE two great rocks which all the children of men are in danger of ſuffering the everlaſting ſhip-wrack of their ſouls upon, are preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſpair. And for preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (becauſe of our natural pride, ſelf flattery, high thoughts of our ſelves, our carnal ſecurity and multitudes of other inbred diſtempers) it is hard to eſcape it; and it may be ſaid of this, that it hath ſlain it's ten thouſands. But for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency; multitudes of poor awakened ſouls, who have eſcaped the danger of preſumption, have miſcarried hereon; From a deep ſenſe of their ſins and miſery they have been apt to fall into an overwhelming ſenſe of both, and to look upon their wound as incureable, and their diſeaſe paſt healing. Some think ſo well of themſelves that they ſtand in no need of help: others think ſo ill of themſelves that they look upon themſelves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46197:15"/>as paſt all help: It is no eaſe matter to keep in the middle between both. Theſe are both dangerous to us, and highly derogatory to the grace of God; both are a reproach to his kindneſs; On the one hand to think that God would be at that vaſt expence and charge, to make ſo full proviſion for poor ſouls beyond what they need: this is to make the blood of his Son to run waſt. To think on the other ſide that the proviſion that God hath made is too narrow, ſhort, and ſcant for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: this is a great reproach to the mercy of God. But becauſe this is frequently the caſe of ſouls whom the Spirit of God convinceth of ſin, and are not yet throughly convinced of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, they ſtick in theſe Bryars, and are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, By the diſcovery of his rich and free grace; the boundleſsneſs and unfathomableneſs of his mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by diſcovering ſo many rich and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, as they are called 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. By which he gives incouragement to them to come to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By notable inſtances of his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant mercy to ſinners in times paſt, leaving them as monuments for ages to come: as here in S. <hi>Paul</hi> and others. The Apoſtle in the 15 verſe, ſaith, <hi>(This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, whereof I am chief,)</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46197:15"/>having ſet down the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ches of Divine Grace, and the full proviſion that God hath made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for the chief of ſinners, propounds himſelf here in the text, for on example and pattern to ſtrengthen the faith of others: and by his own experience to incourage them to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yal of what he had ſound ſuch full and ſufficient relief from: <hi>How be it for this cauſe I obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c.</hi> In the words here is — 1 S. <hi>Pauls</hi> humble and thankful acknowledgment of that kindneſs and mercy which God had ſhewed to him; — 2. The gratious interpretation and Conſtruction, with the improvement he makes of this mercy. 1.8. <hi>Pauls</hi> humble and thankful acknowledgement of that kindneſs and mercy which God had ſhown him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How be it I obtained mercy]</hi> there is an emphaſis in the words <hi>how be it;</hi> I who ſeemed to be at ſuch a diſtance, and remoteneſs from <hi>mercy,</hi> I who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo unmeet, ſo unworthy, and under ſo many diſcouragements, and great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages (for what caſe can poſſibly go beyond mine?) <hi>how be it I obtained mercy:</hi> though my caſe was ſo bad. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as can ſcarſely be paralelled, I that was (in the 13 verſ.) <hi>a Blaſphemer and a Perſecutor, and Injurions, yet I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly in unbelief,</hi> (not that S. <hi>Paul</hi> would thereby extenuate or diminiſh his ſins, he onely comforted himſelf in this that his ſins were committed out of ignorance, there was more of miſtake then maliciouſneſs in them; and that he did not intend an extenuation or diminution of his ſins, appears becauſe he aggravates them ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46197:16"/>much and maketh it ſo great a wonder that ever ſuch an one as he ſhould obtain mercy). He ſpeaks it as a matter of admiration and aſtoniſhment; for if any perſon may ſeem to be uncapable of mercy, ſaith he, I was as like as any, I came ſo near the borders of the unpardonable ſin, that it is a wonder to me, and to all that underſtand what my carriage hath been, that I ſhould obtain mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the interpretation that S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes of the kindneſs of God to him: it is not ſingly to him, to his benefit, to his perſonal and peculiar advantage, but for the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others in after times, <hi>For this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long ſuffering for a pattern to them which ſhould hereafter believe,</hi> &amp;c. It is the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a humble and thankful ſoul, <hi>For this cauſe I obtained mercy,</hi> that in me firſt:</p>
            <p>Firſt, how? it cannot be underſtood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of order of time, becauſe there were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes who had obtained mercy, that lived in the ages before and as great ſinners as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> and others, in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>How then doth he ſay <hi>in me firſt?</hi> Not ſo much in reſpect of the order of time as the clear evidence of the riches of mercy: In me firſt, that is in me chiefly; thus many learned interpreters expound it: Beſides the word is the ſame with that in the verſe before <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is tranſlated there, Chief, <hi>This is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners of whom</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſenſible of this in the mercy that he himſelf had partaken of, I obtained mercy, but it was that I might <hi>be a pattern to them who believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of this in that prayer of his 51 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. when he had been pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning of God for mercy, 9. verſ. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins,</hi> &amp;c. 13, <hi>Then will I teach tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, do but ſhew me theſe favours and mercies and I will improve them for the benefit of others, 40. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth his faithfulneſs to God, and his thankfulneſs for the mercies he had received, becauſe he did thus declare it.</p>
            <p>Nay, this is the very end of Gods leaving theſe things upon record, the kindneſs he ſhews to his people, and the ſeverity he expreſſeth toward his enemies, that theſe might be improved by us to our good, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>For whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall not inſiſt on this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>One of the higheſt expreſſions of our thankfulneſs to God for the mercies he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to us, is to do our utmoſt to encourage others to own and acknowledge, and to come in to God, and partake of what we enjoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a wonder doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> make it here that he had mercy from God, <hi>How be it I obtained
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46197:17"/>mercy;</hi> though ſuch and ſuch a one as I was, <hi>yet I obtained mercy; but it was for a pattern to others that hereafter ſhould believe on him to everlaſting life;</hi> He debaſeth himſelf as low as hell and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods mercy above the heavens; indeed every thing of mercy is a great wonder conſidering what we are in point of vileneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but it is an evidence that mercy is then in mercy when it doth not onely elevate and lift up our hearts in admiration and praiſing God, but in commending him to others as the object of their truſt and hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doct. <hi>That the ſcope and aim of every Perſon ſhould be everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Doct. <hi>That the onely way to obtain this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life is in a way of believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Doct. <hi>That the work of beleiving is a difficult work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Doct. <hi>Becauſe it is a difficult thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve therefore God hath appointed all kind of helps for the working of faith in the hearts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall wave all theſe, and ſpeak to this:</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>God is pleaſed ſometimes to ſingle out Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and notorious offenders, to make them the objects of his ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing mercy to the end they may be as ſtanding inſtances and famous Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his mercy in after ages; and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all occaſions of doubts, ſuſpicion, and jealouſies which humble ſinners are in danger of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine muſt be warily underſtood. I do not ſay God always or ordinarily doth ſo; this cannot poſſibly be: it is contrary to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and truth of God. As God is a holy God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46197:17"/>be cannot but abhor ſin. Though he hath mercy ſometimes on the greateſt ſinners, yet he bears a perfect deteſtation to ſin: therefore ſin is called ant abominable thing, <hi>do not that abominable thing that I hate.</hi> He cannot but have an infinite diſpleaſure againſt ſin becauſe it is ſo unſuteable to his holineſs, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5, 6, 7. <hi>The Lord trieth the Righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his ſoul hateth. His countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> and thoſe only, with approbation and delight.</p>
            <p>So as to the truth and veracity of God in his threatnings againſt ſin, which he hath ſo ſeverely pronounced his diſpleaſure againſt, he is in point of his truth and faithfulneſs obliged to make good what he hath threatened as well as promiſed. Therefore God doth not always nor ordinarily make notorious ſinners the objects of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy, becauſe this would make God a ſeeming approver of what himſelf hates, and a countenancer of what he puts a great diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon: but ſometimes God ſingles out ſome notable ſinners and leaves them as inſtances and monuments to after ages, and it is to this end and purpoſe that they might be as ſo many Beacons on a hill to warn others to take heed of their ſins, and to give light to others to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, notwithſtanding their objections, doubts, and fears. Sometimes you finde S. <hi>Paul</hi> admiring the grace of God ſhewed to him; that he who was at that remoteneſs and diſtance from mercy, ſhould find mercy and favour; You have a notable inſtance in the 2 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Wherein in times paſt</hi> (ſpeaking of them in their Gentiliſm)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46197:18"/>ye <hi>walked according to the courſe of this world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This was a ſad condition, to be under the power, to be captive to the will and pleaſure of ſuch an uſurper.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 4. <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy,</hi> hath quickned us together with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the 7. verſ. <hi>That in the ages to come be might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he might leave ſuch ſtanding objects of his mercy as might obviate and prevent all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in doubting Chriſtians, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> propounds himſelf ſingly in this Text I ſhall confine my ſelf to that particular inſtance, and the end and account, upon which he obtained ſo much mercy: it was that he might <hi>be a pattern to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In opening the Doctrine I ſhall ſpeak to three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What thoſe ſins were that S. <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion was guilty of, and notwithſtanding which he obtained mercy, which was in his eye ſo great a wonder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What mercy he did obtain notwithſtanding thoſe great ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What there is of Encouragement from theſe inſtances of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and others recorded in the Scripture for the encouragement of doubting Chriſtians in after ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What were thoſe ſins S. <hi>Paul</hi> was guilty of before his Converſion; You find them ſumm'd up in the 13 <hi>verſ.</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>I was a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer:</hi> That is the firſt; Now blaſphemy was a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46197:18"/>capital crime and to be puniſhed with death, and by ſtoning to death.</p>
            <p>There are two things remarkable in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of blaſphemers: It was no leſs then death, and every perſon who was not guilty was bound to purge himſelf from ſo great a crime by witneſſing his deteſtation of it, <hi>Thy hand ſhall be firſt againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tender Father muſt be ſevere againſt the Child of his own bowels.</p>
            <p>Blaſphemy is branded in Scripture with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny black titles and the puniſhment of it was very ſevere.</p>
            <p>This was the great crime objected againſt <hi>Naboth;</hi> he muſt be carried out of the City and ſtoned as a vile Perſon, <hi>not fit to live becauſe he blaſphemed God and the King,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.9.13.</p>
            <p>A greater crime then this the enemies of our Saviour (notwithſtanding all their combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt him) could not alledge, a ſtronger charge then that of blaſphemy, they could not lay againſt him, 26 <hi>Matth.</hi> 65. <hi>Then the high Prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying, he hath ſpoken bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was the blaſphemy? 61 verſ. <hi>This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſaid I am able to deſtroy the temple of God and build it in three days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was reproachful Language, this fellow, this contemptible fellow ſpake thus and thus, and you have heard his blaſphemy, what need you any more witneſſes. This is ſuch a ſin that <hi>Herod</hi> (though he was not guilty of blaſpheming God himſelf yet becauſe he did ſeem to countenance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46197:19"/>others, who did, when he made that eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the People, <hi>cryed out it is the voice of a God and not of a man,</hi> 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.22.) for his bare connivance at this ſin brought ruine upon himſelf; becauſe he took the glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Becauſe <hi>David</hi> had but occaſioned the <hi>enemies to blaſpheme,</hi> God dealt ſo ſeverely with him; <hi>the Child muſt die,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.14.</p>
            <p>I might ſhew at large with what ſeverity the Magiſtrates were bound to bear witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſin, 5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. And unleſs we expreſs a deteſtation of this ſin we make it our own.</p>
            <p>That is the firſt, a blaſphemer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A perſecutour; and that he was to purpoſe: do but obſerve thoſe emphatical expreſſions by which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets out the hainouſneſs of his guilt of this ſin, 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 58. <hi>And caſt him out of the City and ſtoned him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Act. 1. <hi>And Saul was conſenting to his death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Act. 1. <hi>And Saul yet breathing out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this is the next ſtep to blaſphemy, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecution:) He would neither imbrace Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelf, nor could he patiently endure that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould, but with all the rage and fury im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable he laboured to oppoſe the ways of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was <hi>Injurious,</hi> the word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is but once more uſed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, 1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 30. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, — it is Tranſlated <hi>deſpiteful,</hi> and denotes thus much;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46197:19"/>When his power could not reach the Perſons of Profeſſours, nor the worldly concerns of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, yet he did his utmoſt to blaſt their names and blemiſh their reputation: he was a reviler, he forbore nothing that was injurious to them, but what was beyond his power to inflict. Theſe were his ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What mercy he did obtain notwithſtanding ſuch ſins; and that in three inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sparing mercy, God had born with him: Notwithſtanding he was often guilty of thoſe ſins, which might have brought wrath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction more quickly upon him: he wondered at Gods patience towards him; this is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this verſe, <hi>That he might ſhew forth all long ſuffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he once came to underſtand what he had been, and what he had done, he ſtands amazed at the holy God that had ſo much patience with him. God had (it is true) ſtruck him to the ground, he admired that God had not ſtruck him as low as hell. We are apt to think, beholding the groſs abominations, that are more open and viſible in our days, what infinite patience there is in God, that he doth not immediately break out upon ſuch as are guilty; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> like a poor humble ſinner buſies himſelf at home, and ſpends his wondering chiefly on Gods patience towards himſelf, who had been a blaſphemer, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour, and injurious, and yet alive, and on this ſide hell; yet <hi>a pattern of the patience and long-ſuffering of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He obtained pardoning and renewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in reſpect of that double change that was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46197:20"/>wrought upon him: there was an outward change in reſpect of his State and Condition, and there was an inward change in reſpect of the frame and diſpoſition of his heart. Theſe were the high and choice mercies which he obtained. Mercy in reſpect of his ſtate and condition: Of a childe of <hi>wrath</hi> he became a childe of <hi>mercy and favour:</hi> from a ſtate of death he was brought into a ſtate of life: from a ſtate of condemnation he was brought into a ſtate of abſolution and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as he himſelf ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Even when we were deed in ſins he hath quickned us together with Chriſt.</hi> We were dead, guilty of death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtate of condemnation; but now 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>being juſtified by faith we have peace with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now juſtification is not only an act of mercy, and conſiſts not barely in the remiſſion of ſin, but it is an act of juſtice alſo, in regard of the account upon which ſin is forgiven; this is a Doctrine whereof many in theſe times ſpeak very lightly: therefore to give a right notion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, conſider it doth not only conſiſt in the bare remiſſion of ſin, but this remiſſion of ſin is upon a valueable conſideration, Divine Juſtice having received a valueable ſatisfaction by the blood of Chriſt; For nothing could expiate our ſins but his blood. Now S. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſenſible of the great mercy of God to him, and by this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he means pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>Again, he did partake of purging mercy, in regard of the inward frame and diſpoſition of his heart; This he frequently mentions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That is not all, but he obtained Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionating grace; grace to be employed, to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46197:20"/>made uſe of in the higheſt degree of ſervice to God, and his Church. From the loweſt degree of infamy, he was raiſed to the higheſt place of truſt, 12. verſ. of this Chapter, <hi>And I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord who hath enabled me: for that be counted me faithful putting me into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the Miniſtry be never ſo much deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he accounted it a high honour to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; he that was a blaſphemer, a perſecutour, injurious, that Chriſt ſhould put this honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, here is mercy indeed: for ſuch an offender to be ſpared, to be pardoned, to be ſanctified, to be made uſe of as ſuch a glorious choſen inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God among the Gentiles, this was mercy indeed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What encouragement is there in this, and ſuch like famous inſtances, which God hath left upon record as monuments of his mercy, for broken hearted ſinners, who are ready to ſink under the weight and burden of their own ſins?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Theſe examples and ſtanding monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods mercy to others, are incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to humble broken hearted ſinners; becauſe the ſame Fountain of mercy ſtill ſtands open to us, that was open to them; and by theſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monuments, God hath enabled his people to anſwer thoſe puzzling objections, that do ſtick moſt with them.</p>
            <p>The bowels and compaſſion of a gracious God are open now, which were open to Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the original of all kind of mercies, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46197:21"/>unleſs this be open, every door of mercy is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, 59. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lords hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath the ſame bowels now which he had: he is the fame yeſterday and to day, and for ever, his mercy is <hi>from one generation to another: The mercy of the Lord endures for ever,</hi> It is no leſs then twenty times mentioned in the 136. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> We have the ſame fountain opened to us, that is, the Bowel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is the fame meritoriouſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in the bloud of Chriſt now as was, <hi>He is the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an everlaſting efficacy in his blood.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts ſpeak of their Treaſury of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, that ſinners may live upon if they will give a handſome rate for them: this is a groſs deluſion, and multitudes have been deceived with it.</p>
            <p>But this is true and real in Chriſt; there is a treaſury of all kinde of bleſſings laid up by his purchaſe; <hi>by his once offering up himſelf be hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is the ſame efficaciouſneſs in the Spirit of Grace.</p>
            <p>We have the ſame operations of the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of grace to convince, and to convert, to ſanctifie, and renew us; to prevent us from ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing; and to regenerate us to holineſs; to aſſiſt us, and <hi>to enable us to every good way, and work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you regard the inſtrumental cauſe, there is the ſame vertue in ordinances, now which ever was; becauſe the ſtrength and vertue of ordinances depend upon Gods preſence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46197:21"/>and concurrence with them. Now God hath promiſed his preſence and concurrence to the end of the world, 28. <hi>Matth.</hi> laſt, <hi>Lo, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only with your Perſons while your live, but with your ſucceſſours, by whom the ſame ordinances are diſpenced, when you are dead and gone.</p>
            <p>Again, if you regard the final cauſe, ſalvation and happineſs, God hath the ſame love for the ſalvation of loſt and undone creatures now, which he had of Old, therefore ſays S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Now I ſay,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of the circumciſion, for the truth of God, to confirm the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made unto your Fathers: and that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an account given, why the Goſpel ſhould extend to the Gentiles, <hi>becauſe God will be glorified among them,</hi> 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is able and ready to do for his People, above what they can either ask, or think; That he might have glory in all ages even to the to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We are under the ſame encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe we are under the ſame promiſes that they were, and what there is of difference; is rather of advantage to us, above what it was to them; the promiſes to us are more clear and plain.</p>
            <p>We have the ſame Covenant now, that they had, 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 14. <hi>That the bleſſing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles;</hi> we have the ſame Covenant to plead.</p>
            <p>And the terms and conditions upon which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46197:22"/>mercy is tendered in the promiſes is the ſame; as faith and repentance which was accepted then is accepted now; and theſe conditions are more clear now, then at that time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great deſign and intent of God in ſingling out ſuch Perſons, is that he might give ſufficient antidotes againſt all objections: this is the account S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives in this place, <hi>That in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e firſt, Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering for a pattern to them which ſhould hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how hath God been pleaſed by ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to provide againſt all the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of poor humbled and doubting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hereby ſhews, that as great and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners, as we can think our ſelves to be have been pardoned. <hi>I obtained mercy,</hi> ſaith <hi>S.</hi> Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>who was a blaſphemer,</hi> therefore let no man hence forward deſpair of mercy, for there is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and fulneſs enough of mercy in the boſome of God for the greateſt ſinners. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> (whom the Scripture diſcovers to be as a ſummary or an abridgement of all kind of wickedneſs, 2 <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. Some object the unworthineſs of their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46197:22"/>Perſon; but conſider as unworthy Perſons as you can be have obtained mercy, and been made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of mercy to others, 36. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31.32.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Perſons as unwilling as you have found mercy, 5. <hi>John</hi> 40. Its our Saviours great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint you will not come to me that you might have life; he is willing to give it; what can poor dead Perſons more need then life? he is willing to beſtow it; he invites them to accept of it, <hi>but they would not come to him that they might have life.</hi> But yet many of thoſe obtained mercy.</p>
            <p>Nay, Let me adde farther, is it your inability that diſcourageth you? As unable as you have found mercy; our Saviour tells us, 6. <hi>John</hi> 44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are all naturally unable, unwilling, and unworthy, yet God gives encouragement by theſe inſtances and ſtanding monuments of his favour to anſwer all objections.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This may ſerve by way of reproof to three ſorts of Perſons, Hath God left ſuch ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monuments of his mercy to Notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; even ſuch as is ſufficient to anſwer all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, if they be but once humbled and come to him upon his own terms? Then this may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch as Conſult not the Scriptures, that know not what monuments God hath left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record for our encouragement; at what a loſs are ſuch Perſons for the making uſe of ſuch examples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It reproves ſuch as are careleſs in making uſe of them; that ſeldom concern themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the caſe of their ſouls; that neither Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46197:23"/>how it is with them at preſent, nor how it is like to be with them for the future.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It reproves ſuch as make a perverſe uſe of theſe examples, in turning the grace of God into Laſciviouſneſs and Wantonneſs, in making uſe of theſe examples of mercy, either for the imbolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves in ſin, to the hardening of their hearts againſt Gods fear; or to encourage themſelves in the delaying their repentance, and applying themſelves to God for mercy; but let looſe the reins of their Corruptions, becauſe ſuch great ſinners have been pardoned; Therefore a Pardon is eaſie to be had, it is but crying God have mercy upon me: Oh, take heed of ſuch bold Preſumption in ſin; it is a moſt dangerous thing to play the wantons with the tender grace and mercy of God; how many are apt to plead for the juſtification of their ſins, becauſe many have been ſaved, who have been guilty of their ſins. I do not know of any kind of ſins but God hath given us inſtances of his ſaving ſome from ſuch ſins: But what a high degree of blaſphemy is this to pervert the grace of God to ſuch contrary ends to what God intended it.</p>
            <p>All along in Scripture theſe Monuments are mentioned, to keep us humble, thankful and lively in the ſervice of God; and not to enbolden us in ſin; this is quite contrary to the whole deſign of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Hence ſee alſo, the neceſſity of keeping theſe famous inſtances freſh in your thoughts, for the ſupporting of your Spirits; Oh, think what their caſe is, how difficult and dangerous, who forget theſe examples? and what ſucceſs they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46197:23"/>will find who improve them faithfully and not wantonly. And conſider the great difficulty of believing: it is what God Commands in a way of Condition: and it is what God hath promiſed in a way of grace: it is beyond our power to believe: who hath believed our report, to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed: it is onely the mighty Arm of God that can work faith in ſuch hearts as ours are. How much prejudiced are we againſt every thing of Faith? as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt? What a hard task had S. <hi>Paul</hi> with many of the Churches, (as the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) to bring them off from their ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and truſting to their works? Oh, it is not an eaſie matter to bring our hearts to cloſe with Chriſt, to think that Chriſt will entertain thoughts of mercy towards us. Theſe are the two Capital Miſtakes by which moſt of the world miſcarry, either to think ſo ſlightly of ſin, as not to regard it: or ſo black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſin as to think themſelves paſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Let what hath been ſaid encourage you to make this uſe, to ſtrengthen your faith, and to lay hold humbly and thankfully on the promiſes made to you: it is to this end that God hath left ſuch paterns of mercy on record for us: and conſider it is the principal deſign of Satan to rob you of faith, to weaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and to keep you off from believing, <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee as wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Satan can but deſtroy our faith he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our peace, comfort, and ſafety. Nay, he doth at once rob us of all. I ſhould have ſhewed the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46197:24"/>ſinfulneſs of unbelief, when God hath been ſo gracious, not onely to make ſuch full promiſes, and ſuch gracious offers, but to leave ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and paterns of his graciouſneſs, and that yet we ſhould be unbelieving, and ſtand off from God; this falſe kind of humility is that which hath deceived many; let an awakened ſinner therefore take heed of it: It is to this end God hath left examples of his mercy to others, to encourage others that ſhould believe on him in after ages.</p>

            <p>THough God hath not thought meet to exempt his people from affliction, yet he hath taken care that they ſhall not be deſtitute of ſupports ſufficient to bear them up above dejections in their afflictions; and of all the encouragements that we finde upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Scriptures, this is none of the leaſt, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions here in the Text; <hi>giving thanks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle begins this Epiſtle according to his uſual and accuſtomed manner, to wit, with prayer on the behalf of them to whom he writes; the bleſſings he prays for are chiefly theſe three,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they may know the will of God, and know it fully; this you have in the 9. verſ. <hi>For this cauſe we alſo, ſince the day we heard it do not ceaſe to pray for you, and to deſire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second thing he prays for, is, that they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46197:25"/>may obey the will of God, and obey it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally; and that you have in the 10. v. <hi>That they might walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, being fruitful in every good work, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing he prays for is, that they might ſubmit unto the will of God, and ſubmit to it with chearfulneſs, and that you have in the 11. verſ. <hi>Strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering with joyfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things; that are eſſential to a ſincere Chriſtian, The knowledge of Gods will, The practifing of what he knows, and then not onely the doing of what God Commands, but a ſubmitting to what God inflicts: Theſe are the three things the Apoſtle prays for, and it is worth our while to conſider, the order in which he prays for them, — Firſt, He prays that they may know the will of God: they did know it in ſome meaſure already, but he prays that they may know it fully; knowledge is that which makes way for practice; without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Solomon</hi> tell us the minde cannot be good; but knowledge alone cannot ſpeak our condition to be ſafe; A great deal of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the worſt of Creatures have had, not onely the worſt of men, but the worſt of Creatures, but that knowledge which is an unactive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is little better then the knowledge of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, for they 2. <hi>James</hi> 19. <hi>believe, and tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore the Apoſtle here prays, that they might adde to their knowledge obedience, and that this obedience might be full; but our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46197:25"/>obedience can never be compleat, unleſs it be as well in ſubmitting to the providential will of God, as in doing his Commanding will; You read of a twofold will of God; his preceptive will, that ſets before us the rule of our duty, and his providential will, and by this he orders all our affairs; we muſt ſhew our obedience in both.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle having therefore thus recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Spiritual eſtate of theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to God by prayer, he goes on and encourageth them to follow his prayer with ſuitable endeavours, <hi>giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There are in theſe words three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An eminent priviledge, An inheritance in light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The means by which this priviledge is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that is, we muſt be made meet before we can be made partakers of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The duty that lies upon all them whom God hath been thus far gracious to, as to make them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light. They ſhould be full of thankful acknowledgements and praiſes, giving thanks, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whatever their outward condition might be, though they lived in times of trouble, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, though many black clouds did then hang over the Church of God, yet God is merciful, for which you ſhould be thankful, and which may cauſe you to rejoyce in his goodneſs, what ever your outward condition may be.</p>
            <p>I ſhall a little explain the words, and then proceed,</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46197:26"/>
            <p n="1">1. Here is an eminent Priviledge, and that is in general ſaid to be an inheritance, the Original is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to part of the Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> properly ſignifies a lot: moſt interpreters think it to be an alluſion to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when by their ſeveral tribes, and families, they had their inheritances divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; it was all done by lot, they took it by lot, every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had his Portion, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance by lot, ſo hath every gracious ſoul here this ſpiritual inheritance.</p>
            <p>More particularly, it is ſaid to be an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, not Common, but an inheritance peculiar to the Saints, that is, to them that are renewed, and Sanctified; to them that are born again, for though the word ſanctification is uſed ſometimes in a larger ſenſe, yet here it muſt mean an inward, and through work of grace, The inheritance of the Saints in light. But then as it is no ordinary inheritance, ſo neither is it any deſpicable, or mean inheritance, it is called here an inheritance of the Saints in light. The word light in Scripture, is frequently put for comfort, thus you read in the 8. <hi>Eſther</hi> 16. it is ſaid there, when <hi>Mordicai</hi> was advanced into favour with <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and thoſe black clouds were blown over the heads of the Jews, then had they light, and gladneſs, So in 97. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous,</hi> light, that is, joy, <hi>and joy for the upright in heart:</hi> 112. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. you have the like expreſſion there, <hi>to the upright ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth light in darkneſs,</hi> that is, though for the preſent he may be under many troubles, and perplexing thoughts, yet light is ſown: though
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46197:26"/>at preſent the ſeed ſown under-ground, ſeems to be dead, and wither, yet it will bring forth a plentiful increaſe. Sometimes it denotes not onely comfortable things, but the tranſcendent excellency of things; thus it is ſaid of Satan, he transforms himſelf into an Angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>an Angel of light,</hi> that is, an Angel of glory, a bleſſed Angel: in the 104. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. God is ſaid, <hi>to Cover himſelf with light, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> it denotes the tranſcendent excellency of his Majeſty; ſo that you ſee this inheritance is no mean nor ordinary thing, it is no deſpicable thing, it is peculiar to the Saints, it is the inheritance of the Saints in light, that is, it is a glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inheritance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is the means by which alone this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance can be obtained, that is, none can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, but thoſe that are firſt made meet for it: This is a neceſſary prediſpoſition in all who do partake of this Inheritance; they muſt firſt be made meet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the word Meet is often tranſlated worthy: Sometimes it ſignifies ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>bring forth fruit meet for repentance,</hi> that is, as becomes repentance. <hi>Let your Converſation be as becomes the Goſpel, A giving thanks to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hath made us meet,</hi> this implies two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we are naturally unmeet, we are not born <hi>meet,</hi> we muſt be made <hi>meet;</hi> who hath made us <hi>meet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That our being made meet, is not the fruit of our own endeavour, but of Gods grace: who hath made us meet; it is not our act, but Gods goodneſs; it is not any ſtrength of our own, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46197:27"/>the care, and <hi>love</hi> of God, who hath made us thus, for <hi>who bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one, Job</hi> 14.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is the duty that lies upon them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom God hath been ſo gracious as to make them meet to be partakers of this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, They ſhould be continually giving thanks, that God hath been ſo good unto them, it is more then if God had bleſſed them with all the good things of this world, it is more then if God had given them the utmoſt of what they can deſire, nay more then their deſires can reach.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral obſervations which may be raiſed from the words, Theſe two I ſhall give you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doct. <hi>What ever the condition of the people of God may be for the preſent, yet they have an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people of God are in this world, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their <hi>non-age,</hi> as heirs that are under Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and Guardians; They may have a right, and title to very large Priviledges; but they are under age, they have not the fruition of what is their own. This is the very alluſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>Now I ſay, that the heir ſo long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a ſervant, though he be Lord of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know the firſt-born, he is an heir, though he be but an infant; Now all the Children of God are ſtiled his firſt born this you may ſee 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 23. <hi>The Church, of the firſt born,</hi> how? not of the will of man, nor of the will of the fleſh, but of God and as the Children of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are born to Honours; and the Children of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46197:27"/>rich Men to Eſtates, ſo the Children of God, are born to this inheritance. I ſpeak not of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but Spiritual birth; that are born again. It is ſaid of our Saviour, that he is the great heir of all things; and it is ſaid of the members of Chriſt, that they are co-heirs with him: and what is that to which they are heirs? It is ſo fully, and affectionately deſcribed, and ſo Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, that it is worth our while to pauſe a little upon it, in the many expreſſions concerning it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again,</hi> &amp;c. There is Regeneration; but to what? <hi>To a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this, I ſhall only alledge ſome few arguments, That it muſt needs be ſo, that the people of God, (thoſe that are truly regenerate, and born again) have an inheritance intailed on them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt argument is drawn from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition here on earth, this ſpeaks that they muſt have ſomething future.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Comforts in outward things are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually fewer then others: The Papiſts make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity a mark of the true Church, but how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this is to the hiſtory of the Scripture, and the experience of all ages, I need not mention: We find God many times is abundantly gracious to thoſe in theſe ſpiritual bleſſings, to whom he gives very little of outward Comforts; In our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46197:28"/>Saviours time, you read the poor received ſhe Goſpel, ſo in after times, 2. <hi>James</hi> 5. you read <hi>God hath choſen the poor in this world, rich in Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many that are low in the world, yet high in eſteem with God; I do not ſpeak as if there was an Inconſiſtency between theſe things, but I ſpeak of what is the uſual Condition of Gods People, in reſpect of theſe outward things: Now, it cannot be imagined, that God ſhould be more liberal, and bountiful in any ſorts of bleſſings to his enemies, then to his ſons; that he ſhould extend bounty in any kind more largly to them he hates, then to thoſe he loves;</p>
            <p>Now, in that God ſo often beſtows leſs of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things upon his people, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows more upon his enemies; this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that there remains ſomething for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the People of God. This argument hath ſo far prevailed with many of the heathen, that they have been convinced there is another world, wherein God will manifeſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his Judgements, as the Apoſtle calls the day of Judgement, <hi>the day of the revelation of the righteous judgement of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As their outward comſorts, are uſually fewer, ſo their delights in, and Affections to what they enjoy are uſually lower, they do not look on the things of this world, as any great matter: when others account the world their Idol: In the 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 37. you read what the duty of the people of God is, <hi>He that loveth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me: and be that loveth ſon or daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:46197:28"/>
            <p>Others may make them Idols in their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but it is the duty of a gratious ſoul to keep theſe things low in its thoughts. The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church you have in the <hi>Revelations, The woman is cloathed with the ſun, and hath the noon under her feet;</hi> her feet were where others hearts are, ſhe trampled on the world. Now God ſometimes calls his People to an actual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of theſe things for him; you read, 12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. That God called <hi>Abraham to leave his fathers houſe, and his native country, and his friends, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>equaintance,</hi> and to go he knew not whither, and amongſt he knew not whom, and <hi>Abraham</hi> yielded obedience: So <hi>Moſes,</hi> 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 25. <hi>He choſe rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Diſciples, 19. <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. left all. <hi>Then anſwered Peter, and ſaid unto him, behold, we have forſaken all, and followed thee:</hi> And though God doth not call us to ſuch actual forſaking of all things for him, at all times, yet to an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, to a diſpoſitional forſaking them: that is, to a deſpiſing, and an undervaluing of them for himſelf: thus far God calls to forſake them at all times. Now for as much, as their outward comforts are fewer, and the comfort they take in theſe outward things are meaner, it argues that God hath ſome thing better in ſtore for his people than theſe things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their outward afflictions are uſually greater, then others, and that partly out of Gods love to them, and their love to him, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the malice of their enemies, but partly out of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46197:29"/>Gods love to them; 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>Every ſon whom he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> loves he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have need of afflictions, God out of his fatherly care is pleaſed to afflict his, more then others: you find when God was angry with his people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he diſcovered his anger by this, in that he would not vouchſafe to make know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> himſelf to be angry: <hi>Why, ſhould you be ſmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> any more? Iſaiah</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>God would not be at the pains to correct ſuch: Now as Gods love to his People, makes their a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions greater then others, ſo many times their love to him, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 37. <hi>They were ſtoned, they were bewn in ſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword: they wandred about in ſheep skins, and goat skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe primitive worthies, might eaſily have eſcaped dangers, and ſhunned thoſe calamities that they under-went; but its ſaid <hi>they accepted not of deliverance, that they might obtain a better reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, they were more tender of the glory of God, and their faithfulneſs to him, then what ever in the world was of higheſt eſteem amongſt them. So if you look over the book of God, you ſhall find, though all men have had a portion in afflictions, yet the people of God have uſually had a larger ſhare; how many oppofitions, have they met with, upon no other account then upon the account of their faithfulneſs to God: <hi>Abol,</hi> was not only perſecuted, but murdered, by his Brother. <hi>Abraham</hi> met with no ſmall tryals, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times; ſo <hi>Moſes:</hi> I might ſpeak of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46197:29"/>which would be too large to mention; how <hi>Elijah</hi> was forced to fly for his life, <hi>Micaiah</hi> was fed with the bread of affliction, and waters of Adverſity; and Eccleſiaſtical writers tell us, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawn aſunder: and the Scripture that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was put into a dungeon: and hiſtory tells us, that he was afterwards ſlain in <hi>Babylon:</hi> and therefore many ancient writers do frequently mention the flaming buſh, the Ark toſſed upon the waves, to be excellent Emblems, to deſcribe the State of the Church here upon the earth; This buſh is ever burning, but not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Gods care of it is ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The only ſupport that Gods people have here, is their hope of this inheritance. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> what they muſt expect to meet with; and ſays he, you have need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that after you have done the will of God, you may reap the promiſes; Yet ſays he, a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and the juſt ſhall live by his faith. Alaſs, ſhould they live by ſenſe, their comforts would be ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded; but they live by faith, that is, they live above theſe outward things, and mind their ſpiritual, and heavenly concernments, 10. <hi>Heb</hi> 34, 35. You read in the 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 24. what was S. <hi>Pauls</hi> great ſupport, when <hi>he went bound in the Spirit to Jeruſalem, None of theſe things move me; Neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry; which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had higher things in his eye, then all theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46197:30"/>things were; this was that ſupported him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If we had hope only of Chriſt in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now; if you put all theſe together, Conſider what the caſe of Gods People is in this world, and what their carriage is; then certainly, there muſt be an Inheritance remaining for them; ſome thing better, ſome thing greater, then what they enjoy here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon is this, Conſider, the price that Chriſt hath paid to purchaſe this inheritance for them; When Chriſt was leaving the world, he tells them, I go to prepare a place for you; In my fathers houſe there are many Manſions; Nay, he tells them in the 14. <hi>John,</hi> that this was the very deſign of his coming into the world; and can we think that all that agony, and all thoſe ſtrong crys, that he offered up in the days of his fleſh, ſhall be loſt, and diſregarded; Now, what his deſign in all his ſufferings were, you may ſee, 17. <hi>John</hi> 24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me: for thou lovedſt me before, the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot think that God who looks upon that as a condemning ſin in others, to trample under foot the blood of Chriſt, that he ſhould do any thing like this himſelf: The 53. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is an excellent Chapter to deſcribe thoſe tranſactions that paſt between the Father, and Son, in order to mans redemption; Chriſt he undertakes to ſuffer on their behalf; And the Father he undertakes the ſucceſs of his ſufferings, in letting of him, ſee of the travel of his ſoul.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:46197:30"/>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the promiſes of God, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promiſes of God, are a ſure foundation to build upon; The promiſes of a man, though of the greateſt of men, are but mutable; God hath bid us to ceaſe from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils; Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: Put not your confidence in Princes: and in the 62. <hi>Pſal.</hi> you have many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to that purpoſe; But the word of God, this is a ſure foundation, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall ſooner fail, then one jot or tittle of what he hath ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God hath promiſed, a future ſtate of glory to his people, a future inheritance.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider the earneſts, and pledges, that God doth in this world afford his people of their future inheritance; he gives them ſome pledges, that they may know how ſure it is, and he gives them ſome fore taſts, that they may know how ſweet it is: 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted, after that ye had heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalvation: in whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the redemption of our purchaſed poſſeſſion, unto the praiſe of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the Doctrinal part; What ever the condition of the people of God may be for the preſent; yet, they have a future inheritance: they may have but little perhaps in poſſeſſion, but they have much in reverſion: they may have nothing in hand; but they have a great deal in hope. For the uſe and application of this point,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What folly is it then, to judge of them that are ſincerely gracious, by what is preſent? Alaſs, if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46197:31"/>you judge of things, or perſons, by what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to outward things, this is a falliable rule. In the 73. <hi>Pſal.</hi> the Pſalmiſt eying this rule ſo much, was in great danger of miſtaking, but be at laſt recollects himſelf, and ſays, If I ſhould ſpeak thus, <hi>I ſhould offend againſt the generation of the righteous.</hi> So 37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</hi> His beginning may be trouble, his continuance may be with oppoſitions, but his end ſhall be peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place, Is it ſo?</p>
            <p>Then let us make no miſconſtructions of Gods dealings with us. If we can but anſwer this great queſtion, that we are in the number of them that have a right to this future inheritance, we have reaſon to entertain good thoughts of God, what ever he is pleaſed to do with us, as to other things; If God hath been gracious to us, in the choiceſt mercies, we ſhould not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hard thoughts of him, if he with hold or remove ſmaller mercies; If he hath been gracious to us in diſtinguiſhing bleſſings, we ſhould not be ſo apt to challenge God concerning theſe outward bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If this is ſo,</p>
            <p>Then let this engage us quietly, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bear what ever afflictions God may be pleaſed to exerciſe us with. But you will ſay, It is a hard matter to be patient under preſent affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when we are in doubts concerning our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eſtate and condition; to be under trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles now, and not to know when an end of theſe troubles ſhall be, this muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46197:31"/>and therefore let this engage us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To labour to reſolve this great queſtion, whether we are in the number of them to whom this Inheritance belongs. You ſee it is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Children of God; every one that is born again, that is born of God, is born to this inheritance: but I ſhall ſpeak more to this, when I ſhall ſpeak of that part of the text, of being made meet; and thus, we may know it, by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the work of grace in our own hearts: but becauſe. I ſhall inſiſt on that afterwards, I ſhall wave it now; Now thoſe that have once reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this querie, it becomes them to be patient in bearing what God doth exerciſe them with: Conſider how patient God hath been towards us; ſhall we be impatient towards him: and let us conſider, our future comforts, and they will more then ſufficiently recompence all our preſent ſufferings, <hi>I reckon, that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time; are not worthy to be compared with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſhall be revealed.</hi> 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Nay, how helpful and how conduceable, is this quietneſs of Spirit, to fit us for this Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! But you will ſay, What is it to be quiet and patient under the hand of God, —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not every kind of ſtilneſs of ſpirit; there may be a ſtupidneſs and blockiſhneſs of Spirit: therefore in one word, to be patient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afflictions, doth not exclude a ſenſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but a dejection of ſpirit under afflictions; You find, 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. that God complains of his ancient people, <hi>though he had ſmitten them, yet they would not receive correction: O Lord, are not thy eyes upon the truth? thou haſt ſtricken them, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46197:32"/>they have not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction: they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God had ſpoken to them by the voice of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that was a ſtill voice, they turned a deaf ear to that Language: God ſpake to them in a louder Language, by the voice of Judgement; Now God takes it ill that this would not awaken them: We ſhould be ſenſible of afflictions, but not caſt down by affliction; it is the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe extreams, inſenſibleneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though it does exclude dejection under afflictions, yet it doth not exclude humiliation for ſin: The People of God that have the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their ſincerity, being ſenſible of the hand of God upon them, muſt be careful to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It doth not exclude a deſire to have afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons removed, but rather increaſes a deſire to have them ſanctified. Some are all for eaſe; but a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſon would have the ſore cured, before the plaiſter be taken off, he would not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from a courſe of Phiſick, till he finds Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual health; afflictions are Gods Spiritual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, to be patient under Gods afflicting hand, does not ſilence prayer, but ſilenceth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorineſs in prayer; it makes us ſubmiſſive in our prayers to God, <hi>Father if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble let this cup paſs, yet nevertheleſs not my will but thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:46197:32"/>
            <p>If God ſees it good, if it may make for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, God will intruſt us with theſe mercies he at preſent deprives us of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Farther, it doth not cauſe us to neglect means, but it reſtrains us from the uſe of unwarrantable means; how many in times of danger, if they can but ſhift off danger, though they run their ſouls into danger by it, they care not: but patience keeps the ſoul in an even frame, between theſe two extreams; it neither doth neglect thoſe means that God hath appointed, nor dare it break Gods fence, nor trample down his hedge, to eſcape danger; that is the word by which the New Teſtament deſcribes ſin, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a breaking of Gods fence.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, It doth not hinder the ſoul from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but it quickens it unto duty, and does inliven it in duty: ſuch a frame of ſpirit, does very much become them, who are able in any meaſure to clear up their title to this Inheritance. I have ſpoken now only in the general, What ever the condition of Gods people may be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet, this is their advantage, they have an Inheritance for the future.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Doctrine is this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>That this inheritance of the Saints is no mean, ſlight, nor contemptible matter, but it is an excellent and glorious inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is called an inheritance in light; and for the perſons to whom it belongs, it is peculiar to the Saints: Obſerve the manner of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, he cannot ſo much as mention it without a holy kind of admiration, <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks to God which hath made us meet to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46197:33"/>be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all theſe expreſſions do demonſtrate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> high eſteem that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had of this inheritance it is in his eſteem a mercy more then ordinary, and the partaking of it, a mercy beyond all other mercies: and if the ſpeaking of this inheritance be a thing ſo admirable, what will the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it be! I ſhall a little in general, before I come to particulars, ſet before you ſomething of the excellency of this inheritance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider thoſe Emblems by which the Scripture deſcribes it; it is called <hi>a heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:</hi> thus you have it, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>And a better Country: they looked for a better Country:</hi> It is mentioned twice in the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> it is in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance that God beſtowed upon his people of old; but the inheritance that God hath reſerved for his people hereafter, is ſaid to be a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and a far better Country. <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Country that God did wonderfully bleſs: if you conſult Scripture, and Geographers, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a miracle, that ſo ſmall a ſpot of ground ſhould contain ſuch a vaſt number of people, at you read in the Scripture it did, the extent of it being ſo little. — Sometimes it is called a <hi>City;</hi> and Cities of old, were places of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, both for ſtrength, and beauty: It is called <hi>the City of the living God,</hi> and the <hi>heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 22. and to have not only an heavenly Country, but a heavenly City, this is a higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, — Sometimes it is called <hi>a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 32. <hi>Fear not little flock: 'tis your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:46197:33"/>
            <p>Now in a City there may be ſeveral ranks of perſons, one may be great, another may be mean; One may be in a full condition, another may be in an indigent eſtate: So it is in all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdoms too; but here all are Kings; every gracious ſoul is a King, and a Prieſt to God, in this kingdom, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 32. <hi>It is given</hi> in common to the people of God, and therefore they are ſtiled <hi>Kings and Prieſts to God,</hi> 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Now what preferment can be greater then a Kings? this is the higheſt ſtep of honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: What a Kingdom is here? and what Kings are theſe? Angels are attendants upon theſe Kings; <hi>they are Miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth for the good of the elect,</hi> 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Nay, theſe ſervants of God who are ſtiled Kings, ſhall Judge the world, yea, the Angels themſelves ſhall be Judged by them, the evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 7. What greater or what manner of enjoyments can be imagined, that is not in this Kingdom, There are <hi>Rivers of pleaſure at Gods right hand for ever,</hi> 16. <hi>Pſalm, the laſt verſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes it's ſet forth by a <hi>Crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that <hi>recompence of reward Moſes</hi> had an eye unto, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 26. This recompence doth not ſignifie any deſert on mans part, but abundant kindneſs on Gods part: Even in the Covenant of works; there was no proportion between the work that God required, and the recompence that God promiſed; The work that God required of <hi>Adam</hi> was finite, but the recompence that God promiſed was infinite; the everlaſting enjoyment of himſelf. Alaſs, we poor creatures can deſerve nothing at the hands of God, but wrath: Could
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46197:34"/>we live in the greateſt exactneſs of obedience now, that we might have done in a ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; yet, when we had done our All, we had been but unprofitable ſervants, our righteouſneſs could not have reached God, we could not have made him our debtor; Alaſs, he is infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſins, and the ſervices of his poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but it only ſhews the greatneſs of his bounty. This is the firſt, The Emblems by which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; I have given you ſome of many; It is a Country, a City, a Kingdom, a Crown, a Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the tranſcendent excellency of this inheritance. I ſhall inſtance only in ſome few of many, and before I begin to ſpeak particularly of theſe excellencies, Conſider, they are ſuch as when we have ſaid all we can, all is but a dark repreſentation of them; 'Tis true the excellency of this inheritance is, that it is ſo perfect and full, that there is neither the mixture of any evil, to allay the comfort of that bleſſed State, nor any interruption by any adverſary, to diſturb the enjoyment of it. Theſe are great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; They who are in the full poſſeſſion of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, are not only above the reach of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but above the capacity of ſinning; and in this reſpect we are far above the eſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; for then we had mutable natures, though we might have enjoyed very much, yet we might have loſt, and did looſe all: but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is more ſure; it is an inheritance eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon ſurer promiſes. You read, <hi>We ſhall follow the Lamb, whetherſoever he goes,</hi> and we ſhall ſee <hi>God face to face, and know him as we are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46197:34"/>known of him.</hi> Alaſs, now we know but in part, and enjoy but in part; what we have, is but little of what God intends; ſome ſmall foretaſts.</p>
            <p>And then Conſider, it is not only thus full, but it is likewiſe eternal, and <hi>for ever,</hi> without any ſucceſſion; there is no defect in it, no expiration of it; <hi>it fades not away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And though it be diſtributed to many; yet, this diſtribution does not at all diminiſh the comforts of it; for ſuch is the infinite fulneſs of God, that he can never be exhauſted. Though thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Veſſels be thrown into the ſea together, yet there is enough in the ſea to fill them all, and one hath never the leſs, becauſe the other is full beſides; every one is brim full: So thoſe that ſpeak of the degrees of glory, they ſay every one is as full of glory as they can receive. But to inſtance in particulars, would be too large, and therefore I ſhall only ſpeak in general concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tranſcendent excellencies of this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: It is ſuch as exceeds all reſemblance: Could we extract the ſweetneſs, that is in all Creature excellencies, and ſumme them up all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one; Nay, did all theſe meet in one perſon, without the leaſt mixture of any evil, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt interruption, or diſturbance, yet all theſe were but very weak reſemblances; Nay, it doth not only exceed all compariſon, but it goes beyond all expreſſions: You find when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of this inheritance, 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 18. he heaps up expreſſion upon expreſſion, looking upon all expreſſions to be inſufficient; <hi>The eyes of your underſtanding being enlightned: that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46197:35"/>the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reported of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> upon the loſs of his good friend (it was upon the death of S. <hi>Jerome</hi>) he comforted himſelf in the loſs of him, by ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, and meditating upon the joys of heaven; and when he laboured to ſet forth the excellency of thoſe comforts in his meditations, he thought he heard a voice telling him, he might as ſoon empty the ſea with a ſpoon, as deſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the excellency, and greatneſs of thoſe joys. You find in the 64. <hi>Iſa.</hi> God himſelf tells us, that they are ſuch <hi>as neither eye hath ſeen, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> heard, but that is</hi> not all, they do not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all expreſſions but all conceptions; out words may be high, but our thoughts may go beyond what our words can expreſs; but they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our thoughts, <hi>It hath not entered into the heart of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of them, he ſpeaks by way of admiration, <hi>How great is that goodneſs thee thou haſt laid up for thoſe that fear thee, Pſal.</hi> 31.19.</p>
            <p>It is greater then I am able to expreſs, greater then I am able to think; Nay, God deſcribes himſelf, 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 20. to be a God that does for his people beyond what they can ask or think; Now, our raiſed thoughts, and apprehenſions when they come up to their higheſt pitch, do not reach the excellency of thoſe enjoyments, 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>Behold, ſays</hi> S. <hi>John what manner of love the father hath beſtowed upon us that we ſhould be called the ſons of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is aſtoniſhed at what God hath done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; <hi>Behold what manner,</hi> &amp;c. but yet ſays he, We know not what we ſhall be; S. <hi>John</hi> was that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46197:35"/>Diſciple that lay in the boſome of Chriſt, that had many ſingular diſcoveries made to him, but ſays he, We know what we ſhall be; Nay, let me adde one word more, it is not only beyond all compariſon, and all expreſſions, and all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benſions, but the tranſcendency of this inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is ſuch, as is beyond all Scripture Revelations. For you may find it is ſtiled a glory that ſhall be revealed in us, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, revealed fully, Indeed God hath revealed enough of it already, to make every thing in this world contemptible, and to cauſe us to have mean thoughts of all things elſe; but the full and perfect diſcovering of this inheritance, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for another world: we know not what we ſhall be, but this we know; we ſhall know him as we are known of him, and ſee him as he is, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (becauſe our teſtimony among you was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) in that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is the ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The excellency of this inheritance may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear if you conſider the concurrance of all things that may ſtrengthen the title of Gods people to this inheritance: Reckon up all the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that can be to any eſtate, and all meet in this inheritance; Do any claim a right to any inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by way of gift; This is the gift of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32.</p>
            <p>Do any claim a right by way of purchaſe? This is the puchaſe of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 14. it's called <hi>the purchaſed poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:46197:36"/>
            <p>Do any claim a right by way of Conqueſt? Chriſt hath conquered all thoſe enemies that might keep Gods people from it.</p>
            <p>Do any claim a right by way of Inheritance? It is theirs by ſucceſſion, for they are the children of God. If any have a title to an inheritance is any of theſe reſpects ſingly, if their title be right, their inheritance is ſecure; but here is a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all theſe belonging to the people of God: this inheritance is the gift of God, the purchaſe of Chriſt, conqueſt of Chriſt, and it is theirs by ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, the admirable certainty of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this inheritance: God hath promiſed it, <hi>and faithful is he that hath promiſed. My father is greater then all;</hi> No power can over-match him, <hi>My father is greater then all and none can take you out of his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath undertaken, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>That they ſhall be kept by his power, through faith unto ſalvable,</hi> They ſhall be kept, and kept by the mighty power of God, &amp; kept from danger, ſo long as there is any thing of danger remains; they ſhall be kept till they are landed in that bleſſed inheritance: It is Gods promiſe, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words in the Greek are very emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he hath ſaid <hi>I will never leave thee,</hi> &amp;c. which God aſcertains by no leſs then five Negative Particles.</p>
            <p>And if God hath ſaid it, it is not for us to queſtion it, The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> had ſo much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Maſter, that they lookt upon it as too much arrogancy to queſtion his dictates.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:46197:36"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 6. <hi>He that hath begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where God hath once laid the foundation of grace, he will carry on the ſuperſtructure, when God hath brought home any ſoul to himſelf, he will take care of that ſoul; it is his promiſe it is his Covenant.</p>
            <p>And ſo much in general for the ſecond Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the excellency of this Inheritance — For Application, I ſhall only inſiſt on one or two Uſes.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo, That this inheritance is no mean, no ſlight, no contemptible thing, is it ſo admirable that it exceeds all compariſon, all expreſſion, all conception, all Scripture revelation? Then, This may inform us, how well it is with the people of God in this regard, let it go never ſo ill with them in other things; there is enough in this ſingle Meditation to render their condition love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, above the condition of all others: Who would not chuſe the eſtate of poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> rather then rich <hi>Dives:</hi> who would not chuſe the eſtate of <hi>Job</hi> upon the dung-hill, rather then <hi>Pharaob</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne: who would not rather be in any kind of condition here (ſo they may but obtain this bleſſed condition hereafter), then enjoy all the delights and advantages of this world, and be deprived of, or come ſhort of this inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Certainly there is enough in this ſingle meditation to ſupport the hearts of the people of God in their greateſt trials and troubles.</p>
            <p>Are all the ſincere people of God intitled to ſuch an inheritance? and ſhall they moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46197:37"/>be poſſeſſed of this inheritance; are they upon ſo ſure a foundation, and is it in ſo ſure a hand; though they have enemies without them, and enemies within them, inraged enemies, diligent enemies, enemies that continually endeavour to overthrow them, yet are they at ſuch a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they ſhall at laſt poſſeſs ſuch an inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? this ſpeaks their condition to be truly good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This may inform us, what cauſe we have to be aſhamed, and to ſtand amazed at our own &amp; others neglects of this inheritance: is their ſuch a thing as this to be obtained? and yet how do the generality of men beſtow their time upon trifles, and vanities, and how little hath this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of their time or thoughts? May not God expoſtulate with the profeſſours of our age, as he did with the profeſſours of old, <hi>Why do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which profiteth not?</hi> Iſa. 55.2.</p>
            <p>Since there is ſuch fulneſs of happineſs to be had, why do we buſie our ſelves ſo much about things of an inferiour nature? we have cauſe to be amazed at others, thoſe that hear of heaven, and the glory of another world, that they ſhould live in a continual neglect of theſe things; and what cauſe have we to be aſtoniſhed at our ſelves? we that are acquainted with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and yet are ſo ſlight in our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after them: Alaſs, amongſt thoſe that profeſs the name of God, how few mind this inheritance, with that earneſtneſs, as they do other things? Do they live as thoſe that are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46197:37"/>convinced that heaven is ſuch an inheritance as hath been related? Alaſs, is not this to deſpiſe the greateſt of bleſſings? Therefore a little to awaken us out of our Spiritual Lethargy, and to make us more ſerious, and intent about the things of heaven, I ſhall only propound one or two Arguments,</p>
            <p>Conſider what it is you neglect; It is ſaid of the Jews, <hi>had they known him they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;</hi> had they known him to have been the Lord of glory, they would not have Crucified him: ſo may I ſay, did we know what it is we deſpiſe, we would not thus deſpiſe it as we do, You read of the wiſe Merchant, 13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 45. <hi>He no ſooner heard of the Pearl of great price, but he ſold all he had and bought it,</hi> he was willing to part with all ſo he might but purchaſe the Pearl: Is it not ſtrange, that the diſcovery of <hi>thoſe things which God hath laid up for his people in the other world,</hi> hath not the ſame effect upon us? Conſider what it is you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, and then you cannot but wonder at your ſelves, while you behold others diſtracting their thoughts, breaking their ſleep, and filling their hearts with cares, and are reſtleſs for the things of this world: Nay, are out-ſtript by you, as to your endeavours and cares for thoſe things that are ſo far tranſcendent, and ſo admirable. Shall they take more pains for periſhing comforts, then you do for everlaſting mercies? Conſider but this one thing; The glory in this inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that God will put upon the very bodies of his People, and Conſider the glory in this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46197:38"/>that God intends to put upon the ſouls of his People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The glorious excellencies, and perſech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that God intends to put upon the bodies of his People; they are now ſtiled <hi>vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, corruptible bodies,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.42, 43, 44. ſpeaking of the bodies of the Saints, <hi>Though it be ſown in corruption it ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in incorruption,</hi> Theſe poor bodies of ours, are now fading and withering things, <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the goodlineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as the flower of the field; the graſs wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the flower fadeth, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What more periſhing then the graſs; all the art in the world cannot long prop up theſe poor tabernacles of clay; they muſt moulder into duſt. It was a vain boaſt of proud <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that he could make man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, but God convinc'd him of his folly, for he died in the ſtrength of his years. Now, though it be a withering dying body, a paper building, that muſt be diſſolved; though it be ſown a corruptible body, it ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in incorruption: now what an admirable change is this?</p>
            <p>It is now a <hi>vile body;</hi> that is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the 43 <hi>verſ.</hi> It is <hi>ſown a vile body,</hi> it is raiſed in honour: it is vile in reſpect of thoſe many diſtempers, and noiſome diſeaſes, and frailties, this poor fleſh of ours is ſubject to, but it ſhall be raiſed in glory. Conſider, if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſuch glory upon his face, when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46197:38"/>he had been converſing with God upon the mount, what glory will God then put upon theſe poor bodies of his People, when they ſhall enjoy him ſo <hi>fully,</hi> Conſider that of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 34. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>So when <hi>Steven</hi> was arraigned as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, at the bar of Juſtice, <hi>they ſaw the glory of God ſhining upon him,</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. Thus you read of <hi>Daniel,</hi> 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third expreſſion, you have 44. <hi>verſ.</hi> It <hi>is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> here is a ſeeming contradiction in the terms, if a body, it is no more ſpiritual if ſpiritual it is no more a body: for a full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this, a learned expoſitour gives theſe his thoughts, we ſhall never compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what this means till we come fully to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it; but thus far we may ſafely ſpeak, it ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual body; that is, free from all natural dependencies; Alaſs, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny props do theſe poor bodies need, for their ſupport, how many Creatures looſe their lives to maintain ours, in this reſpect all our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dependencies ſhall then be removed, God will take away our crutches; Yes, and our lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo: it ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual body.</p>
            <p>All the art in the world cannot preſerve theſe poor bodies from decay; nay it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from noiſome, and deſtructive weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they are bodies full of weakneſſes, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46197:39"/>under a neceſſity of many ſupports, but theſe corruptible bodies ſhall be raiſed in incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe vile bodies ſhall be raiſed in honour, theſe natural bodies, ſhall be raiſed ſpiritual bodies.</p>
            <p>This is the great honour that God will put upon the bodies of his Saints; ſuch honour have all his Saints in reſpect of their bodies; they ſhine as ſtars in the firmament.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p n="2">2 COnſider the glory that this Inheritance doth contain in reference to the ſouls of the Saints. <hi>Bernard</hi> breaks out into this high expreſſion, how great ſhall the glory of Gods people be when their very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be as glorious as the Sun, and they ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the firmament, — Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of the ſouls of the Saints, I ſhall not be large in treating of that; All the faculties of their ſouls ſhall then be more inlarged and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to receive in more of God, to take in more of happineſs, then now they are capable of: our ſouls now are but narrow veſſels in compariſon of what they ſhall be then; the ſoul of man is too big a veſſel for the world to fill: Whence is it, that we thus purſue the world as our only happineſs? it will never ſatisfie us. Men wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from one creature to another, but they do not find happineſs: <hi>They ſeek the living among the dead;</hi> the ſoul is too wide for theſe things to fill it: but then it ſhall be widened and ſhall
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46197:40"/>have a larger capacity then now it hath. Our underſtandings ſhall know more of God; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is one of the great accompliſhments of man; it ſets him in a higher rank of being then other creatures: and that there is a very great excellency in knowledge, appears, becauſe this was the bait Satan made uſe of; ſo ſhall you be as Gods knowing good and evil; that ſubtil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary knew no bait more taking. Knowledge in it ſelf is a moſt lovely and amiable thing; but in compariſon of ſpiritual knowledge, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of our ſelves, all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is but poor and mean. The Philoſopher when he had been much admiring the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nature, did wonder that any would give way to ſenſual and bruitiſh pleaſures, which they by the light of nature ſo much condemned. But what is this knowledge in Compariſon of the knowledge of Chriſt? All knowledge whether Natural or Divine, is now but weak, and feeble, ſcant and narrow; how little doth any man know of himſelf, how many things are there in Nature that to this day do remain a myſtery and riddle to the wiſeſt of men: how little do we know of God? but then our knowledge ſhall be widened. So our wills and affections are now but narrow and weak things; they can hold but a little, but then they ſhall be enlarged. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>We know now but in part, and we love now but in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, not only ſhall all the faculties of the ſoul be thus widened; But all the graces of the ſoul
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46197:40"/>ſhall be perfected, there ſhall be no defect nor weakneſs in them, there ſhall be no dimneſs in our ſpiritual ſight, our Wills and Affections our Love and our Joy, they ſhall all be full of ſtrength: as a man is in his full ſtrength when every member of his body comes to its ripeneſs and maturity, 4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 13. <hi>till we all come to a perfect man, to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 28. <hi>The ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> that is their ſouls: then there will be no mixture of Corruption to diſturb our graces or to interrupt the exerciſe of them, 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 27. <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Alaſs, the ſpouſe now acknowledgeth, though ſhe is comely, yet withal ſhe is very black: not onely in reſpect of perſecution but in reſpect of inherent diſtempers; but Chriſt will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his Church hereafter without ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. The gold of Gods People ſhall then have nothing of droſs in it: their wine then will have nothing of water in it, our graces and Comforts then will be both unmixt; there ſhall then be no halting in our obedience, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our propounds this as the pattern of our prayers, that we ſhould pray, that the will of God may be done here on earth as it is done in heaven: How is it done in heaven? perfectly, without any weakneſs, without any intermiſſion. In a word there ſhall be neither ſin, nor Satan, nor corruption, nor temptation; not a vain thought, not a wry look, nothing that may diſturb
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46197:41"/>the graces, or darken the Comforts of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the ſweet Communion that ſhall be between the People of God and Saints and Angels. The Communion of Saints, it is a kind of heaven here upon the earth; but what will this Communion be in that bleſſed inheritance when we come to be fully poſſeſt of it. The Apoſtle mentions this, as one of the great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Goſpel, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 22. <hi>We are come to mount Sion, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We do not now converſe with God, as we did at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but in another manner.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> when he was a Priſoner did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it his joy that he was a fellow Priſoner with holy <hi>Bradford.</hi> If the Communion of Saints in priſon have ſo much of ſweetneſs in it, what is the Communion of Saints in glory?</p>
            <p>Conſider, we ſhall then have Communion not with a few onely, but with the whole Collective body of the Saints that have been in all ages, and therefore it is ſaid, they ſhall <hi>ſit down with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and to have Communion with the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes and Prophets and Apoſtles, and all the holy men of God that ever lived: how refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt this Communion needs be? Nay, then we ſhall have Communion with none but Saints; as with all Saints ſo with none elſe. Alaſs in this world we live in the midſt of a mixt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and our comforts are frequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by falſe brethren that creep in amongſt us; you know how much <hi>Lot</hi> was diſturbed by the <hi>Sodomites:</hi> and ſometimes they creep into
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46197:41"/>the very Church too. God complains in the 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> of a mixt multitude who were not of the ſame ſpirit with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua:</hi> they were men of another ſpirit and followed God fully. Now how much is the ſweetneſs of the Communion of Gods People here upon earth damped by the miſcarriage of profeſſours? how much many times does Religion ſuffer, and the name of God ſuffer, yea how much do they themſelves ſuffer and their holy profeſſion? but when the ſheep ſhall be ſeparated from the Goats, the tares from the Wheat, and the Chaff from the Corn, Communion with the Saints muſt then be much more delightful.</p>
            <p>Again, it ſhall not only be with all the Saints but with the Saints in their perfection and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt improvement. Take the beſt of Saints here on earth and they have ſomething in them that renders their Communion unlovely. It's ſaid of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> he was a man of like Paſſions: and the Apoſtles themſelves when the people would have adored and worſhipped them, they cryed out, do not this thing <hi>for we are men of like paſſions with your ſelves.</hi> The beſt of men have ſomething in them to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are but men: take the holyeſt and the moſt improved Saint who ever lived, you find ſomething recorded in Scripture which ſhews he was yet in a ſtate of imperfection: that he was not arrived to that bleſſed eſtate that this Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance implies. Now to have Communion with Saints, and all Saints, and none but Saints, and Saints in their utmoſt and higheſt improvements, and in a ſtate of perfection, this muſt need be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:46197:42"/>
            <p>Farther to have Communion with Saints in their higheſt imployments, in praiſing and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and admiring of God. To have Communion with thoſe that are godly in civil converſe, in ordinary viſits is a refreſhment eſpecially in times of common calamity; how refreſhing is the ſight of gracious Perſons? but to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them in praiſing and bleſſing God; in ſinging <hi>Halliluiahs</hi> is very pleaſant. <hi>Moſes</hi> thought Communion with Gods people a deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing in the time of affliction; therefore it is ſaid he made it his choice, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> And if it be ſo in a ſuffering Condition, what is it in a glorified ſtate? and if in Civil matters, what is it in theſe Spiritual imployments?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Such Communion with them that ſhall never be interrupted, as ſhall never expire; <hi>they ſhall be for ever with the Lord:</hi> This ſhall be the Portion of them all, and they ſhall be for ever to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. In this world the company of friends is pleaſant, but that which damps their refreſhments is the thoughts, that there muſt be a parting; but there will be no intermiſſion. Then it ſhall be our work and priviledge for ever. Put then all theſe together, to have ſuch a glory put upon our bodies, and improvement on our ſouls, and to have ſuch Communion with Saints, what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtate will it be?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider that ſweet Communion with God; thoſe full enjoyments of God which he hath reſerved for another world. Indeed this is the main, the higheſt part of this glorious Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46197:42"/>It is the preſence of God that makes heaven what it is; it is that which fills heaven with all its happineſs and unſpeakable glory. <hi>Luther</hi> propoſeth an imagination; could we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that God could withdraw his preſence from heaven it would ceaſe to be heaven any longer, and it would be a dark and uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place: In the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.21.22. as <hi>Phinehas</hi> his wife ſaid, when the Ark was taken (it was not the Child that was born or any other thing that ſhe could take comfort in) the <hi>glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Iſrael.</hi> If God be gone all is gone: The enjoyment of God is the higheſt advantage that creatures are capable of. Thoſe enjoyments of God which the Saints have here on earth are infinitely beyond all other enjoyments whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. There is no comfort, no happineſs like to this, and were there no other happineſs but this in this life, certainly the people of God were the only happy people becauſe they live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: they are happier becauſe they have enjoyments that are higher and better then others have; they have meat and drink that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers know not of; therefore you read in the 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>The Lord is the Portion of my cup, v.</hi> 6. <hi>the lines are faln to me in pleaſant places, yea, I have a goodly heritage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He doth not envy the condition of others, he only admires the goodneſs of God to himſelf. The godly man, 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. is declared to be the onely happy man, becauſe he delights in the Law of God, and meditates therein day and night, 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:46197:43"/>
            <p>And therefore they muſt needs be bleſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a ſight of God, 144. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>happy are the People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the conſtant Character of a happy man he is one that lives in Communion with God.</p>
            <p>I might prove by ſeveral arguments, that the beſt of other enjoyments, without this, are but very mean to the ſoul, that knows what it is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Communion with God, 84. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10. <hi>A day in thy courts is better then a thouſand,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> regards neither Crowns nor dignities, nor all Creature enjoyments in compariſon of the enjoyment of God, 63. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. <hi>thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better then life:</hi> Life of all outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings is the very top and higheſt of them, it is that which renders us capable of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: ſays the Devil, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life, but thy loving kindneſs is better then life;</hi> the word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal — is very emphatical it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>lives;</hi> that is life with all its advantages, Therefore 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to behold the beauty of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. He had affectionate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires; 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>Many ſay who will ſhew us any good; Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,</hi> &amp;c. He priſed this beyond Corn, Wine, and Oyl. This hath been the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them concerning Communion with God, who have had moſt acquaintance with him, and they are in matters of this nature to be moſt credited; To live in this world, and to live as they in the 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 12. <hi>without God in the world,</hi> is a poor kind of living, though they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46197:43"/>live in honours, and the enjoyment of all other kinds of comforts. <hi>Abraham</hi> (when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Gods promiſe) was not unſenſible of all the kindneſs he received from God but he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon all as little, unleſs he had the promiſe of a ſome made good to him, <hi>What is all this if I go Childleſs:</hi> much more may it be ſaid, if God gives us never ſo much of all other enjoyments and yet hide his face, that ſoul that underſtands it ſelf, cannot but be troubled: there is enough in the want of this ſingle mercy to imbitter all other comforts and all other mercies, and little comfort to be enjoyed in all our enjoyments, unleſs withal we may enjoy Communion with God.</p>
            <p>Another argument is this, The worſt of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will become eaſie and tolerable; yea, ſweet and pleaſant to them that have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God to ſweeten their afflictions: where can I be well without thee ſaith <hi>Bernard?</hi> How can I be ill with thee? while I enjoy Communion with thee? He ſays of Creature comforts they are little, if we look at the priviledge of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion with God: the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is infinitely more in God then in all Creatures. How can he be poor who hath him for his Portion in whom are all riches, who is all things? How can he be in want that doth not want the light of Gods Countenance which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better then Corn, Wine, and Oyl.</p>
            <p>What are the worlds frowns if God ſmiles?</p>
            <p>What though men condemn us if God juſtifie us? What though men be againſt us if God be but for us? That anſwers all, 3. <hi>Habbac</hi> 17, 18.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46197:44"/>
               <hi>Though the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom yet will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. The Prophet propounds as ſad a caſe as can be imagined, yet ſays he, <hi>we will rejoyce in the Lord, we will joy in the God of out ſalvation.</hi> 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Though I walk through the valley</hi> (though it be through the valley of <hi>death,</hi> that dark and uncomfortable valley) <hi>I will fear no evil for thou art with me.</hi> The three Children in the fiery furnace were in no ſad condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was with them: the Apoſtles in their ſufferings thought this enough, for their ſupport, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 9. <hi>perſecuted but not forſaken.</hi> S. <hi>Paul (Though all forſook him yet God ſtanding by him)</hi> thought he had enough; <hi>perſecuted but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken caſt down but not in deſpair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Chriſt was ſending out his Diſciples up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that difficult imployment to plant the Goſpel in the world, he tells them that they muſt expect to meet with oppoſition, but he gives them this for their comfort, I will be with you, <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them, and lo I am with you to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is enough in that promiſe to bear them up above all diſcouragements. This was the great requeſt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 33. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. So all that have had any ſenſe of their Spiritual concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have expreſt this to be their great deſire. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid <hi>if thy preſence go not with us carry us not up hence.</hi> They were now in a wilderneſs, compaſſed about with difficulties and dangers on every ſide, but if thy preſence go not with us, carry us not hence; though we are in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet we had rather have thy preſence here, then to go into <hi>Canaan</hi> without thy preſence.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:46197:44"/>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe enjoyments the people of God have of him here, are very little in Compariſon of thoſe they ſhall have of him hereafter: what God hath reſerved for his People in another world tranſcendently beyond other enjoyments. As all enjoyments here compared to thoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are but empty things, ſo all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God in this world, are far ſhort of them, that they enjoy of him in the other world.</p>
            <p>Becauſe in this world we enjoy God but Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but then the people of God ſhall enjoy him immediately. In this world, what ever we enjoy of God it is but darkly; what ever ſight of God we have it is either through the glaſs of the Creature, or the glaſs of ordinances, or the glaſs of experiences; through the glaſs of the Creatures: and thus we may ſee much of God, his wiſdom, his power, his greatneſs, 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament ſheweth his handy work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are very high expreſſions concerning the things of Nature, how much theſe help us in our ſight of God; But the ſight of God in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, is a higher ſight; therefore <hi>David,</hi> 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God for the living God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That I may ſee thy glory:</hi> how? <hi>even as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary:</hi> he had never ſuch a ſight of God, as in his ſanctuary, as in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; this is that which <hi>David</hi> highly Magnifies.</p>
            <p>And there is the glaſs of experiences: theſe are very admirable too; See God purging out remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corruptions, carrying on the work of grace in the heart, and ſetting up his kingdom in the ſoul: <hi>To taſte and ſee how good and gratious he is,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:46197:45"/>and to have an inward ſenſe of theſe ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments, theſe are high and glorious things; but to ſee God <hi>face, to face to ſee him as he is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſhall be more full and perfect; in this world they are but imperfect, God ſhews us but his back part, as he did <hi>Moſes,</hi> 33. <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>We know but in part, but then we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3, 2. There are faculties by which eſpecially we ſhall then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Communion with God, our underſtandings, wills, and affections; In this world our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are dim, we ſee but little of God, we are ſhort ſighted, but then, 33. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 17. <hi>thine eyes ſhall ſee the king in his beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now they ſee the land afar off but then they ſhall ſee the king in his beauty, ſee him on his throne in his glory; this muſt needs be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſight indeed. All our knowledge of God here is one of theſe three ways, as the School men tell us, by way of Cauſality, Negation, or by way of Eminency. By way of Cauſality; So we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all thoſe excellencies which be in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt needs meet in God; as all the lines in the Circumference meet in the Center, and all the Rays and ſhinings in the air meet together in the Sun, as the common fountain.</p>
            <p>So by way of Negations ſeparating thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections from God, with which every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is clog'd in the Creature. As for example Wiſdom and Power; there is much of folly mixt with humane wiſdom: and much of weakneſs mixt with created power. Though there are ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God that we call incommunicable as the Infiniteneſs, unchangablenes and Eternity of God.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:46197:45"/>
            <p>Then by way of eminency, what ever excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is in creatures, all theſe meet in God, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and refined from every thing of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that is not all, they are in God in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and tranſcendent way; and though there be much of this kind of knowledge of God here, yet <hi>to know God as he is, to ſee him face to face,</hi> how much more refreſhing muſt this be!</p>
            <p>And ſo for our wills and affections: Now our love is weak, our delight is weak: Now we are apt to love God for our ſelves, but then we ſhall love God for himſelf, and all things elſe for him. What a different excellency is there in that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, above what we now do attain unto: It is but in ſome degree here, but it ſhall be in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſhall then be more conſtant: in this world though they have ſometimes a bright ſun ſhine day, yet at other times they have a dark gloomy night: This is the condition of Gods people here, though they have the ſeed of grace that abides for ever, and that good part that ſhall never be taken from them, yet the comforts that come from thence are various and full of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties: but the enjoyment of God the Father ſhall have no change, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4, 17. They ſhall be ever with the Lord: we ſhall then ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Communion with him, as never more to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him; <hi>therefore comfort one another with theſe words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Our enjoyments of God ſhall then be more unmixt: we ſhall enjoy him, and nothing elſe but him; there ſhall neither be marrying nor giving in marriage, there ſhall neither be Sun,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46197:46"/>Moon, nor Stars; we ſhall then be as the Angels of God, there ſhall be no need of theſe things. 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 23. <hi>No ſun, nor moon, nor ſtars to lighten is. The lamb ſhall be the brightneſs thereof: God ſhall then be all in all:</hi> there ſhall then be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, No <hi>Cain</hi> to kill, No <hi>Sodomite</hi> to vex, No <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to ſcoff, No <hi>Rabſhakah</hi> to rail, No <hi>Herod</hi> to perſecute, No <hi>Judas</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our enjoyments of God ſhall then be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of wearineſs; <hi>Now though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is willing, yet the fleſh is weak; What could you not watch with me one hour?</hi> If we be but a few hours engaged in the ſervice of God, how ſoon do our ſpirits flag? our affections grow dull? but then there ſhall be no ſuch thing as weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The ſouls of Gods People then, ſhall be raiſed up to a greater fitneſs for thoſe eminent and high pieces of ſervice; the ſinging prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and <hi>Halleluiahs.</hi> That is the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider what we do in ſlighting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing this glorious Inheritance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We moſt unworthily requite the greateſt love that ever was or can be imagined. Does God ſo expoſtulate with his people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe of their ingratitude for outward preſervations and deliverances, thoſe outward mercies beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, 32. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 6. <hi>Do you thus requite the Lord?</hi> May not God much more expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate with us in reſpect of theſe greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? do you thus requite the Lord, <hi>O fooliſh and unwiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath God been ſo gracious to us, as to take
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46197:46"/>care of our ſouls, and of our everlaſting well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and ſhall we thus requite him? Our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements for Common mercies are great, but our engagements for theſe mercies, how much greater are they?</p>
            <p>Coſider what a mercy it is that there ſhould be a poſſibility of our obtaining this Inheritance.</p>
            <p>We who in our natural conſtitution are but one ſtep from hell, and everlaſting flames; and between us, and it there is nothing but a brittle and uncertain life; What aſtonſhing love is this? <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> 3. <hi>John</hi> 16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Now, how diſingenuous and unworthy is it in us to ſlight and undervalue theſe high diſcoveries of love.</p>
            <p>Again, Conſider what a mercy it is not only that heaven is become poſſible, but alſo that God vouchſafes us this priviledge to diſcover the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of heaven to us, with means for the obtaining of heaven, and his bleſſing upon the means, that by all we might be made meet to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this Inheritance. Theſe are mercies that God doth not vouchſafe to all men, 147 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with other nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, not only is this inheritance poſſible, and a diſcovery made of it, and means afforded for the obtaining it, But God gives us alſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to make uſe of theſe means: this Inheritance is not only purchaſed but proffered and tendered: if we are willing to accept, and do not refuſe it, God will beſtow it. Nay, God doth not only proffer it but he importunes our acceptance of it: how often doth Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46197:47"/>and perſwade with a great deal of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that you would accept of this Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, <hi>I have ſtretched out my band all the long to a gainſaying people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther the terms upon which he encourageth us, are only upon the account of free-grace; Who ever will, let him take of the waters of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Come buy wine and milk without money and without price,</hi> 55. <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> God only requires us to bring a ſenſe of our wants, and what a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy requital is this of the love and kindneſs of God, to undervalue this Inheritance?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We hereby render our ſelves (ſo far as we undervalue theſe mercies) ſo far uncapable of partaking of them. It was ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they thruſt away the kingdom of heaven from them, 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 46. That is, as <hi>Beza</hi> upon the place obſerves, their carriage and contempt did declare them unworthy. 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> Chriſt ſent forth his meſſengers to invite to the wedding ſeaſt. The Gueſts were indeed Invited but they all made light of it: What was the Iſſue? <hi>The king ſent his ſervants to call in other gueſts.</hi> God will firſt bring us to prize theſe mercies before he vouchſafe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They who ſlight theſe mercies bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under an abſolute neceſſity of periſhing, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation.</hi> If we refuſe this inheritance we undo our ſelves for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what kind of neglect is it that doth deprive us of this Inheritance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When the neglect is total, and we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the world ſo much above it that we only
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46197:47"/>mind the things thereof: As that rich man, 12. <hi>Luke,</hi> minded his barns, his In-comes, but his ſoul he cared not for, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20, 21. So when we prefer any thing above it, 10. <hi>Matt.</hi> 37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more then me is not worthy of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was <hi>Eſaus</hi> great ſin, his profaneneſs, his ſelling his birth-right for a meſs of pottage; and when we ſo neglect it that we are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undergo any thing for it, or deny our ſelves any thing in order to it, we are rendered all together uncapable of this Inheritance; There are other neglects through weakneſs, and they are ſuch as the people of God are incident unto; as ſins of infirmities: As when they do not pray with that fervency, and ſtrive with that earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for that kingdom of heaven which is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as becomes the excellency of theſe things. Now this kind of carriage may give us cauſe of ſhame and trouble, but doth not cut off our right. That is the ſecond, Conſider what we ſlight, and what we do in undervaluing theſe mercies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider for what it is that we ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue this glorious Inheritance. No man doth ſlight this, but it is in order to the ſecuring of other enjoyments. Now what enjoyments are there like theſe? If there were any better then theſe, then this practice were Juſtifiable. Nay, if there were any enjoyments equally as good as theſe, then theſe neglects were excuſable; but in as much as none are to be compared with theſe, this is that beſpeaks theſe neglects (though but in part) without excuſe. Now what ſhould
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46197:48"/>tempt us to a neglect of theſe glorious things? can we expect to meet with that in ſin, or in Creature and outward comforts? can we expect that the world ſhould be ſo ſweet, as to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the loſs of them? Our eaſe, our ſafety (I might inſtance in all outward things) alaſs, theſe things are but vain while they do continue, and it is but for a moment that they can continue, and there can be nothing of ſatisfaction found in them, they are but ſuch mercies as God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the worſt of men, and they are uſeleſs in our ſtraits, and therefore why ſhould theſe clog us in our purſuits after greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Direction,</hi> What ſhall we do that we may ſhake off that ſluggiſhneſs, and get above that dullneſs of Spirit, that is uſually in us, in our purſuit after matters that do ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Direct.</hi> Conſider, how much it is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and concernment to beſtow your utmoſt earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtneſs there. It was the commendation of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts hearers, 11. <hi>Matth. from the days of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt until now, the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffereth violence and the violent take it by force.</hi> So it is our Saviours adviſe, <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> Striving denotes our utmoſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: it is not endeavours alone, nor is it earneſtneſs for a time, but it muſt be a conſtant earneſtneſs, a fixed courſe in purſuing this glorious Inheritance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Direction,</hi> Be much in the great duty of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation: there are many advantages in it; It gives all kind of truths a free paſſage into our hearts:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46197:48"/>Therefore by Meditation we ſhould be often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a view of this glorious Inheritance; as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> went up to the top of <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and from thence took a view of the promiſed Land, ſo we ſhould often by Meditation take a view of all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. It was the advice of a Learned writer concerning meetneſs for eternity; Says he, if you would be ſerious in preparing for Eternity, do but ſpend one quarter of an hour every day in conſidering what Eternity is. If you would be more lively and vigorous in your prayers and endeavours, be frequent in conſidering what it is you ſtrive for.</p>
            <p>Again, Meditation is admirable not only to imprint the excellency of this Inheritance upon our hearts, but alſo to preſerve thoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that we have of this glorious Inheritance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Now that this may inflame our ſouls with love to God, (in that God hath not only made proviſion for us in this life, but for Eternity, and ſuch a glorious Inheritance as this is), we ſhould be often meditating on this for theſe ends:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe Meditations might quicken us in our obedience. When <hi>David</hi> had conſidered how many and how great were the mercies of God to him, he ſits down and ſays, What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his goodneſs and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me? All I can do is too little, I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think any thing too much, for that God to whom I owe ſo much: Nor am I ever able to perform any thing ſuitable to ſuch mercies. Theſe medications did ſo engage the hearts of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Martyrs, that ſome grieved that they had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46197:49"/>no more lives to looſe for God. Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the only pride that he took in learning was, that he had ſomething to diſpiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem, and account nothing in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt. Hath God a regard to our Eternal good? Conſider but this, and this will be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to quicken us in our obedience, and to make us think that we can never ſufficiently expreſs our ſelves thankful.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The meditation of this glorious Inheritance is uſeful for the ſtrengthening of patience in ſufferings. Though we are now paſſing through a wilderneſs, if we have but a ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a <hi>Piſgah</hi> ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it will bear up our faith from ſinking under diſcouragements. With what reſolutions would this Arm us, as it did the Apoſtles? It made them make light of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> This made them deſpiſe all manner of afflictions, their meditation was ſixt here; He fears no danger that ſets heaven in his eye.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is very uſeful to render what ever is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly in its own nature, or any other way endangering this Inheritance, to render it hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as all our ſins do. Do but think what large proviſions God hath made for his People, that nothing can keep them off from thoſe mercies but their ſins. Theſe Meditations are very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to imbitter the thoughts of ſin. Conſider; the diſtance that is between God and our Souls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is of ſins making, and in reference to our everlaſting welfare, it is only ſin makes the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46197:49"/>What ever diverts us from minding the things of heaven, it makes them inconſiderable. Meditate upon theſe things, and it will render the world a vain thing; and the allurements of the fleſh contemptible and all outward things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words contain the Prophets reſolution, how to carry himſelf in that time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble, and therein an excellent pattern for our imitation. The particular time to which theſe words refer, was a dark and gloomy ſeaſon, a day of rebuke and blaſphemy; many black clouds were already gathered over the heads of Gods people; two neighbouring Kings combine againſt them, and by their united ſtrength deſign the ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the King of <hi>Syria</hi> and the King of <hi>Iſrael. Cap.</hi> 7.1, 2, 6. In this their diſtreſs, ſo tender was God not onely of the ſafety, but of the comfort of his people, that no ſooner do they diſcern their dangers, but he lets them know their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for upon this very meſſage he ſends the Prophet, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and for the ſtrengthening of their faith in believing theſe glad tidings, God gives them many aſſurances of the certainty thereof, both in the former
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46197:50"/>Chapter and in this. In the beginning of this Chapter the Prophet by the name of his Son <hi>Maher ſhalal haſh baz</hi> (the ſignification of which name is rendred in the Margin) declares the ſpeedy deſtruction of their enemies. Whether theſe things were tranſacted in a viſion onely, as thoſe in <hi>Hoſea, cap.</hi> 1. or whether they were real, is not material to determine: Thus much is clear, that their deliverance by the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> falling upon their adverſaries, is foreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd within a little time to be accompliſhed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and ſo ſtrong was the Prophets faith in crediting theſe ſigns of their deliverance, that <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. he turns his ſpeech to the enemies afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, letting them know the vanity of their combinations, and the fruitleſsneſs of their attempts, becauſe God was with his people <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11 he ſpeaks to the people of God themſelves diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from two things, Firſt, From ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafety by unwarrantable and ſinful confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, either with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> or any other Nation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. Such confederacies, though they had been frequent, had never been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but always to their prejudice. Secondly, From timorouſneſs becauſe of approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. As a remedy againſt theſe fears, he propounds the fear of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. the more they fear'd him, the leſs would they fear others. And to encourage them to make tryal of this remedy he tells the advantage of it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. he will be a ſanctuary, <hi>i. e.</hi> a refuge, a ſhelter an hiding place, a place of retreat and ſafety. Thus God promiſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16. and by theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God the Church overcomes all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46197:51"/>her fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet having ſhewn what God will be to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhews in the ſame verſe, what God will be to others, even to ſuch in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to be ruled by him or rely upon him. But becauſe the Prophet found ſo little ſucceſs among the generality of this people, God commands him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, to bind up the teſtimony, and ſeal the Law among his diſciples; thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating (as ſome think) that he would not have the Prophet deal further with thoſe faithleſs and prophane ſcoffers, but reſerve thoſe ſacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Meſſiah, to be imparted to the faithful, who would with due reverence embrace them. Sealing was uſed of old either for ſecrecy, as men ſeal letters, or for ſafety as Merchants ſeal Wares, or for certainty as men ſeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, or for authority as Princes and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Seal commiſſions. Now in theſe words follows the Prophets reſolution, what he would do in the interim, till deliverance ſhould come; Some Interpret theſe words as ſpoken by Chriſt in regard of the verſe following, Others think them a Parentheſis declaring the Prophets reſolution what courſe he would take in that day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble. <hi>I will wait,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the words are theſe two particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The condition or poſture of the Church of God at that time.</p>
            <p>The perſons here ſpoken of are ſaid to be the houſe of <hi>Jacob, i. e.</hi> the family, the ſtock, the line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſometimes ſtiled the houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſometimes the houſe of <hi>David, Iſaiah</hi> 5.7. <hi>i. e.</hi> Gods peculiar people, not onely thoſe who
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46197:51"/>by natural deſcent came from <hi>Jacob,</hi> but thoſe who ſucceeded him in faith, &amp;c. Thus the word is uſed in the Goſpel to ſignifie the Church and people of God.</p>
            <p>The poſture theſe perſons were in. God had hid his face, and when the Sun is Eclipſed, the world muſt needs be dark: It was now a gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſeaſon. God deals with them as <hi>David</hi> dealt with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24. He would not permit him to ſee his face: The phraſe denotes Gods withdrawing his favour in any kind; for the face of God frequently ſignifies his favour, the beholding his face, the enjoyment of his favour, the withdrawing his favour the hiding of his face, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.25, 26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Exemplary carriage of the Prophet in this ſad poſture of the Church, and this is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by two words: I will wait upon the Lord, I will look for him; both ſignifie the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> an earneſt longing and perſevering expectation of deliverance.</p>
            <p>From the words thus opened, ariſe theſe two Doctrinal concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doct. <hi>That God does ſometimes hide his face from them who are the Objects of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>That when God does hide his face from his people, the great work and buſineſs which then lies before them, is to wait upon the Lord, to look for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Doct. <hi>That God does ſometimes hide his face from them who are the Objects of his favour.</hi> A full inſtance of this we have here, What people
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46197:52"/>were there at that time in all the world ſo de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to God? or in whoſe welfare he accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo highly concerned, as the houſe of <hi>Jacob?</hi> and yet theſe are the people from whom God had hid his face. Conſider, but theſe three things concerning this people, and it will appear that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all people, theſe were the people of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and complacency.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The wonderful diſpenſations of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this people in times paſt; when ordinary providences were not ſufficient, either for their ſupply or ſafety, God was pleaſed by miracles to preſerve them, and provide for them: when there was no other way of eſcaping their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, God makes a way for them through the Red-ſea: when the barren earth could not afford them food in the wilderneſs, God ſends them food from heaven, he rains down Mannah into all their Quarters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The peculiar and Covenant-relation, this people ſtood in to God for the time preſent; they were <hi>the people of his choice, Pſalm</hi> 105.6. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 135.4. <hi>The people of his love, Pſal.</hi> 47.4. <hi>A people that God had taken into Covenant with himſelf, and therefore what nation in all the world like this, Deut.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23.24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The promiſes God had made to this people for the time to come; <hi>To them pertained the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, the glory, the Covenants, the giving of the Law, the ſervice of God, and the promiſes, Rom.</hi> 9.4. In expectation of having theſe promiſes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the Prophet here reſolves to wait. But yet notwithſtanding all theſe endearments theſe are the people from whom God is here ſaid to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46197:52"/>hide his face. It is ſometimes the caſe of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, as appears from their doleful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1. 'tis here the caſe of a whole nation, not of the mixed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude onely, but of the whole body of that people, a clear inſtance that God ſometimes bides his face from them who are the Objects of his favour.</p>
            <p>For clearing and Confirming this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, four things are needful to be ſpoke to.
<list>
                  <item>1. What it is for God to hide his face, or what this phraſe implys.</item>
                  <item>2. How far it is that God does hide his face from his people.</item>
                  <item>3. The reaſons for which God hides his face from them.</item>
                  <item>4. The uncomfortableneſs of ſuch a condition.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is for God to hide his face: In anſwer to which conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God does ſometimes hide his face from his Church in general. And that</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he removes the wonted tokens and pledges of his love in any meaſure, he then hides his face; when he does not manifeſt himſelf as formerly; when his people have not thoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and teſtimonies of his gracious preſence, as at other times: As when God ſtrips his people of the means of Communion with himſelf; when he ſends among them a <hi>famine, not of bread, nor of water, but of his word;</hi> when <hi>he drives their teachers into corners;</hi> when he permits <hi>the ark to be carried away from them,</hi> as it was from the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.21. Though God does not totally remove our Candleſtick out of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46197:53"/>it's place: yet when he ſuffers the lights of the Sanctuary to be hid and obſcured, this is ſo fore a degree of Gods hiding his face, that God in compaſſion to his people aſſures them, that how ſevere ſoever he might be in other judgements, he would ſpare them as to this, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30.20. <hi>Though the Lord give you the bread of adverſity and water of affliction, yet ſhall not</hi> thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes <hi>ſhall ſee thy teachers.</hi> The total removing of theſe mercies is to unchurch and ungoſpel a nation, and the ſuſpence of them for ſome time and in ſome degree is the hiding of Gods face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God takes down the hedge of his providence in part, and lets in a torrent of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calamities upon them: This was the caſe of <hi>Judah</hi> here, God does ſo far let looſe the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> upon them, that their very life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7, &amp; 8. of this Chapter, <hi>He ſhall overflow and go over, he ſhall reach even to the neck:</hi> very near to drowning. <hi>The only ſafety of Gods people</hi> from enemies and dangers, is from the <hi>providential care of God;</hi> This is the wall of their defence, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.5, <hi>Job</hi> 1.10. But if this fence be taken away or broken down, they then lie open to the malice and rage of enemies. Whence is it that the Church of God which is as a Lilly among Thorns, as a flock of ſheep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by ravening wolves, hath any days of tranquillity in this it's military condition, but becauſe God puts a reſtraint upon the rage and malice of enemies? But when God takes off theſe reſtraints, no wonder if (as here) <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ready
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46197:53"/>to afflict <hi>Judah,</hi> no wonder <hi>if</hi> Ephraim <hi>be againſt</hi> Manaſſeh, <hi>and</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>againſt</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and both againſt</hi> Judah; <hi>I will hide my face ſays God, Deut.</hi> 31.17, and what follows? <hi>They ſhall be devoured, many evils ſhall befal them, ſo that they will ſay in that day, are not theſe evils come upon us, becauſe our God is not amongſt us?</hi> And as the firſt coming, ſo the long continuance of calamities is aſcribed to the ſame cauſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>Awake, Why ſleepeſt thou, O Lord? ariſe caſt us not off for ever. Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and forgetteſt our affliction and our oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> The providence and care of God are thoſe flood-gates that keep out inundations of miſery, but when God hides his face, theſe flood-gates are open, and no wonder if then the waters flow in upon us. Thus in temporal mercies God many times hides his face from his people, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former head was ſhewn in Spiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And indeed when God hides his face in ſpiritual mercies, he does uſually hide his face in temporal mercies. Thoſe once famous <hi>Aſiatique</hi> Churches ſpoke of <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the loſs of the Goſpel loſt all their outward proſperity. Thus, from the Church in general does God ſometimes hide his face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though God does not in either of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects hide his face from the Church in general, yet he may hide his face from believers in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. When it is the caſe of the Church in general, every particular believer ſhares therein; when the ſhip is endanger'd by tempeſts, no ones private Cabine can be in ſafety. But now
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46197:54"/>in theſe reſpects God is ſaid to hide his face from particular perſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he unchains Satan and enlarges his commiſſion in any degree againſt us. Thus did God by ſeveral ſteps and gradations enlarge Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans commiſſion <hi>againſt Job.</hi> Firſt, Againſt his <hi>eſtate,</hi> he gave that into his hands. Secondly, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>his relations</hi> in putting them within his power. Thirdly, Againſt his <hi>body</hi> in permitting to afflict that; And laſtly, againſt his <hi>ſoul</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him liberty to tempt that. There is indeed no perſon free from temptations, <hi>Adam</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency meets with a Serpent in Paradiſe; Chriſt in whom was no ſin, was yet tempted: and as there is no perſon, ſo is there no condition free from temptation, but as our conditions change, ſo do our temptations change. In fulneſs, we meet with temptations of one kind; in wants with temptations of another kind. And when Satan is ſtronger in tempting, and we weaker in reſiſting, this is an argument of Gods hiding his face. When there is not only a greater frequency but prevalency of temptations, this is a ſore kind of withdrawing. To be tempted is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, but to be overcome by the temptation is both our affliction and our ſin. <hi>The meſſenger of Satan</hi> was an affliction to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but that which ſupported him, was that promiſe, that <hi>the grace of God ſhould be ſufficient for him,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.7, 9. The diſtreſs that <hi>Judah</hi> was in, in this Chapter, was their affliction, but their dejected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under this diſtreſs, and betaking themſelves to unwarrantable confederacies for ſafety, this was their ſin: and thus is it with all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46197:54"/>of God when he enlarges the commiſſion of Satan againſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he leaves us in ſome meaſure to our own corruptions, our unbelief and carnal fears. Thus Chriſt left <hi>Peter</hi> to humble him for his ſelf confidence; and when God does but take off his reſtraints from our corruptions, how maſterleſs and unruly are they? It muſt needs be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſeaſon to the Soul, when God thus hides his face from it. When he deals with it as with the old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not ſtrive with you.</hi> If God ſtrive not with us by his ſpirit, all our ſtrivings are but weak and feeble, if he keep not under our corruptions, it is not in us to keep them under, when God gave up thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> to their vile affections, how prodigiouſly did they degenerate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. with the <hi>verſe</hi> following. Now God is ſaid to give up to vile affections, when he does not preſerve us from them. He is ſaid to harden, when he does not ſoften, to lead into temptation, when he does not keep us from temptation, and ſo to give us up to corruptions, when he does not vouchſafe us ſtrength and aſſiſtance againſt them, but ſpeaks concerning us, as he did concerning them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is unjuſt let him be unjuſt ſtill, and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi> Thus, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Amos</hi> 4 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.39. <hi>Hoſed</hi> 4.17. The beſt of Saints ſo far as God ceaſes to quicken them, ſo far have a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon their Spirits. <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of this, when he oft repeated this requeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>That God would quicken him.</hi> If he keep not up our faith, it ſoon flags. If he ceaſe to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46197:55"/>draw us we can no longer run after him, if he check not our diſtempers they ſoon break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us without control. There needs nothing more to make the air dark but the abſence of the Sun, or to make weeds grow, but a forbearing to pluck them up.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When he withholds thoſe former manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf, which have been not onely the ſupport but delight of their ſouls in times of trouble, and when God in this ſence hides his face, the ſoul muſt needs be troubled. And the more the ſoul knows of God, the larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion it hath had with him, the more afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are theſe withdrawings, the ſpouſe that knew how ſweet the Communion of her beloved was, how impatient is ſhe of his abſence? and indeed none are ſo ill able to bear theſe withdrawings of God in this kinde, as thoſe who have had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him. <hi>David, Heman,</hi> and many other, When their hopes have been darkened, thoſe refreſhing taſtes and enlivening viſions ſuſpended or overclouded, what volums of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have they uttered. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7 8 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81, 82. When God who was wont to give them frequent meetings and comforting viſits, did but ſeem to ſtand aloof off from them. And yet how oft is it the caſe of <hi>children of light to ſit in this darkneſs, Iſaiah</hi> 50.10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When he ſeems to diſregard our prayers, and as little to mind our petitions, as he did <hi>Sauls,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6. Though God had ſeveral ways, wherein to anſwer prayer, yet <hi>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him by none, neither by dreams nor by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46197:55"/>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim nor by Prophets.</hi> In what a deſolate and helpleſs condition muſt that ſoul needs think it ſelf, of whoſe prayers God ſeems to take no notice, prayer is that great remedy God hath appointed for our help when nothing elſe can help us, Even in thoſe perplex and difficult caſes which are above the reach of other remedies, prayer is a remedy very proper, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.29. this kind goeth not out but by faſting &amp; prayer, <hi>i. e.</hi> more ſolemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but now to have our prayers diſregarded, or for God to hide his face, that he will not hear, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. this muſt needs be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this as it is mention'd to be the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Gods diſpleaſure, that he will not hear, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 28. ſo is it mentioned as the ſaddeſt matter of his peoples complaint, that their prayers ſhould not paſs, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44. had the Churches afflictions been greater, its burdens heavier, Yet if God had but ſtood by them, and taken notice of them, they would have thought them much eaſier. When the world is againſt us, if God be for us; this is comforting, but to be caſt off by God this is diſcouraging.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When he diſcovers nothing but anger againſt us; as when God opens a window into our breaſts, and thereby gives us a full view and proſpect of our own wretchedneſs, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals to us our guilt, andat the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals his own love, oh, what a dreadful condition is the ſoul then in, where ever it goes the curſe of the Law and the cry of its own ſins purſue it, <hi>My ſin is ever before me, ſays</hi> David, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. and how does <hi>Job</hi> bemoan himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.23,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46197:56"/>24, 25. <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face from me and holdeſt me for thine enemy,</hi> &amp;c. and verſ. 26. <hi>thou writeſt bitter things againſt me and makeſt me to poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth.</hi> So Job 6.2, 3, 4. <hi>Oh, that my grief were throughly weighed,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit, the terrours of God do ſet themſelves in: aray againſt me;</hi> His afflictions in outward reſpects were neither few nor ſmall, his eſtate was gone, his relations gone, his health gone, but all theſe were ſmall matters in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the withdrawings of God. Had God ſmiled upon his ſoul, he could better have endured his frownings upon all his outward comforts; could he but have diſcerned God to be his friend, he could more chearfully have born all his other tryals: but that which occaſion'd all his pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical moans was Gods hiding his face.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How far is it that God does hide his face at any time from his people.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, God will never totally, nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hide his face from them, 'tis his promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> and if he hath ſaid it, it is not for us to queſtion it. The Diſciples of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had their Maſter in ſo great Reverence, that an <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> he hath ſaid, it, was enough to them, they thought it preſumption in them to queſtion what they had received from him: now though this was too much arrogance in men, either to give or take ſuch an autoritativeneſs, yet when God ſpeaks, he who is truth it ſelf, he who can do all things but <hi>cannot lie,</hi> 'tis not for us to doubt or queſtion.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:46197:56"/>
            <p n="2">2. Poſitively, Though God may hide his face from his people, yet will he not turn it from them, he never ceaſes to love them, though he does not always manifeſt it, he retains towards them the love of a father even when he diſcovers the anger of a Judge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7, 8, 10. <hi>for a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The mountains ſhall depart and the hills be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16, 17, 18. Many times 'tis in reſpect of outward comforts only God hides his face, to let them know the excellency of ſpiritual comforts; ſometimes not only in reſpect of ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but graces alſo, that his people may know their dependance upon him; but ſtill God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards their ſafety.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The reaſons why God deals thus with his people; 'tis not from any delight he takes in their ſorrows, nor from any pleaſure he hath in their troubles. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis to chaſtiſe them for their fins, every ſin is a forſaking God, and conſequently a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking God to forſake us, did not we by our diſobediences withdraw our ſelves from him, God would not withdraw himſelf from us; That the Sun is overclouded, 'tis from thoſe vapours which the earth it ſelf ſends up; but there are ſome ſins eſpecially branded in Scripture as the cauſes of this calamity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Spiritual Idolatry, when our hearts wander
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46197:57"/>from him after ſtrange loves, the great thing God requires is our hearts, if we deny them to him, no wonder if he hide his face from us. When we ſet up creatures in Gods throne, and give that to them which is only due to him, this is high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty and provokes his jealouſie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.17, 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17, 20, 21. God will admit no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, have no partners in our hearts, he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not all in compariſon of him, is not accounted aright to love him, for this ſin God ſometimes gives the ſoul a kind of divorce.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſtinacy and ſtubborneſs againſt all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and inſtructions, <hi>becauſe I have purged thee, and thou wouldſt not be purged,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 24.13. <hi>becauſe the people of Iſrael would none of Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels he leaves them to their own,</hi> Pſal. 81.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lukewarmneſs in Gods ſervice, this was the ſin for which God threatned the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Revel.</hi> 2.4, 5. the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Revel.</hi> 3.15, 16. 'tis not enough that we ſerve God, but we muſt ſerve him with all our might and with all our ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A willing connivance at any known ſin, either in our ſelves, or in others ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, thus in the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Revel.</hi> 2.14. in the Church of <hi>Thyatira, Revel.</hi> 2.20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A diſeſteem of his love and the pledges thereof; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> once loathed their Mannah they did not long enjoy it; when they ſlighted Sabbaths and ſpiritual opportunities God ſends a famine of this ſpiritual food, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. compared with <hi>verſes</hi> 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Unfruitfulneſs under the means of grace, for his ſin God threatned his Ancient people to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46197:57"/>remove his Goſpel from them, they brought not forth the fruits of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To carry on the deſigns and purpoſes of his own grace towards them. God hides his face for a time that he may not hide it for ever; he does not now ſpare them, that he may for ever ſpare them. But more particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hides his face ſometimes, that he may recover his people to a due eſteem of his favour. The ſpouſe flagged in her affections towards Chriſt, his withdrawings raiſe up her deſires.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they may be more wary and cautious in ſhuning whatever might renew theſe breaches again, and conſequently enjoy his favour more fully and more conſtantly. The burnt child dreads the fire.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The uncomfortableneſs of this condition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Proportionably, to the withdrawings of God, there will be a damp uon all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; If the ſun be ſet all the ſtars in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot make day, if God hide his face, it muſt needs be night with the poor ſoul; Thus with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Accordingly, there will be a decay in all our graces; thoſe plants which while the ſun is near, thrive and flouriſh, in the winter ſeaſon ſeem to die and wither; the ſoul of man is but a barren foil in reſpect of all ſpiritual good, while God who is the ſpiritual husbandman, is tilling and dreſſing, and taking pains with it, 'tis then fruitful, but when God withdraws all decays, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There will be proportionably a deadneſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46197:58"/>and inefficacy upon all the means of doing us good. The weapons of our ſpiritual warfare are only powerful through God. The Goſpel <hi>is the power of God, Rom.</hi> 7.16. 'tis not food alone can nouriſh but the bleſſing of God going with it; 'tis not ordinances alone can refreſh, but God in and by ordinances.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every affliction will proportionably become more burdenſon and afflicting; as the heavyeſt of afflictions have ſeemed light to thoſe who have had the preſence of God to ſweeten them, and his aſſiſtance to bear them; ſo the lighteſt of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt needs be heavy to them from whom God is withdrawn. Every ſmall burden ſeems great to weak and feeble perſons, when greater matters ſeem a very nothing to hale and ſtrong perſons. Now as Gods preſence is with us, ſo is our ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If God hide his face from them who are the Objects of his favour, what will become of them who are the objects of his diſpleaſure? If theſe things be done to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry? If this be the ſeverity of God towards them whom he loves, how dreadful is the ſeverity of God againſt them whom he hates? If this may be the portion of them who are in a ſtate of grace, whatſhall be the portion of them who are in a ſtate of ſin? If ſo much be endured by veſſels of mercy, what muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by veſſels of wrath? They may at preſent flouriſh, but what will their condition be in that <hi>day of revelation of the righteous judgement of God Rom.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> When it goes worſt with the people of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46197:58"/>God, 'tis much better with them then with others, they are Objects of Gods favour, though unable at preſent to diſcern any thing but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, their condition is ſafe though at preſent uncomfortable. How vaſt a difference is there betwixt their ſorrows and others joys; The only ground of their ſorrows, is becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diſcern what cauſe they have of joy, and the onely ground of others joys, is becauſe they ſee not what cauſe they have of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It becomes us to conſider in how great a meaſure, this is the caſe of our Church and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hath not God hid his face from our <hi>Jacob</hi> by removing the wonted tokens and pledges of his gracious preſence? How great an Eclipſe is this day upon all our glory? How are we ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of former opportunities? It concerns us the more to be affected with theſe things, becauſe none of us, but by our barrenneſs under former means, and by our contempt of Goſpel privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, have contributed very much to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of his ſeverity. If the Prophet here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts if ſo ſore a judgement for God to hide his face in reſpect of temporal favours, how much greater cauſe have we to lay to heart, Gods hiding his face in reſpect of ſpiritual mercies and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>That when God hides his face, from his people, the great work and buſineſs which then lies before them, is to wait upon the Lord to look for his;</hi> 'tis their work at all times to <hi>wait</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and that not only as ſervants to receive his commands, but as neceſſitous perſons to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his relief, both which are put together,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46197:59"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.2. <hi>As the eyes of ſervants look unto the hand of their Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</hi> There is not that perſon on earth, whoſe ignorance of his duty does not lay a continual obligation upon him, to wait upon the Lord for direction and Councel. Not is there that perſon on earth, whoſe neceſſities and wants, do not lay the like obligation upon him, of waiting upon the Lord for relief and aſſiſtance. Hence is it that the people of God are frequently deſcribed by this Character, they are ſuch <hi>as wait upon the Lord,</hi> believers in the Old Teſtament waited the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of thoſe promiſes, the fulfilling whereof God had reſerved for the times of the Goſpel. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> waited for the ſalvation of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.18. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt <hi>waited for the Meſſiah, Matth.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea waited for the kingdom of God, Mark</hi> 15.43. Simeon <hi>waited for the conſolation of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25. <hi>The Jews look for redemption in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.38. Believers under the New Teſtament are ſaid to wait for the accompliſhment of thoſe promiſes, the fulfilling whereof God hath refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for another world, they are ſaid <hi>to look for the Saviour, Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>To look for that bleſſed hope, Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>To look for Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 9.28. But though it be both the duty and Character of Gods people at all times to wait upon the Lord, yet is it eſpecially their work and buſineſs at ſuch times: the Prophet knew not what better courſe to take in that dark, and gloomy ſeaſon, and therefore he reſolves for himſelf to wait upon the Lord, and by his own example he provokes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46197:59"/>others to do the like; when <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and the people were ſo diſtreſſed, <hi>that they knew not what to do, their eyes were upon God,</hi> — 2 Chron. 20.12. <hi>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him. — It is good that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord, Lam.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18, 20. This is the courſe which God hath preſcribed, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practiſed, and God himſelf hath all along owned.</p>
            <p>For the further clearing of this <hi>Doct.</hi> Two things ſhall be ſpoke to.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The nature of this carriage or duty.</item>
               <item>2. The principles from which this carriage ariſes.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the nature of this carriage, or what it is to wait upon the Lord, and in what acts it doth formally expreſs it ſelf. It is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuch a carriage as reſults from the joynt exerciſe of many particular graces, as faith, hope, patience, humility, repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe and many other graces are neceſſary ingredients to this carriage, and without the concurrent acting of all theſe we cannot wait upon God aright, but more particularly, waiting upon God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An exerciſing faith upon the promiſes, even when providence ſeems moſt to contradict the promiſe; diſtruſt drives us from God, as that prophane Prince, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord, what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> his unbelief repreſents this duty vain and unprofitable, but now faith ſeeks a certainty and ſufficiency of relief in the promiſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46197:60"/>builds upon them, and conſequently bears up the ſoul above all ſinking diſcouragements; the promiſes are wells of conſolation, but faith is the bucket; they are treaſuries of all kinds of mercy, but faith fetches out ſupplies; though there be never ſo much conſort laid up in the promiſes, yet what is all this to us unleſs we do by faith make uſe of them; <hi>I had fainted,</hi> ſays David, <hi>unleſs I had believed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13, 14. There were many diſcouragements in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God, but <hi>David</hi> anſwers all by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the promiſes; and indeed there is no other way to anſwer our Objections but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, thouſands of troubled thoughts may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and burden us, but faith anſwers all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A patient and perſevering expectation of Gods trturn, how long ſoever he delay; Though God do not anſwer us in our time, yet patience waits Gods time; though he do not return ſo ſoon as we deſire, yet will he ſtay no longer then he ſees it for our good; and therefore this is the language of patience, <hi>Habbac.</hi> 2.3. <hi>the viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lie; though it tarry, wait for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry,</hi> Pſal. 37.7. <hi>reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him, fret not thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he that believes makes not haſt.</hi> 'Tis the proper work of patience to wait Gods leaſure, and not to think him ſlack con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his promiſes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37. God hath told us he will come as a deliverer, and patience expects his coming, till at laſt it can ſay with that Martyr Maſter <hi>Glover, He is come, He is come. Saul</hi> waited, as he thought, a long time for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46197:60"/>
               <hi>Samuel;</hi> but at laſt his patience is wearied out, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.8, 9, 13, 14. But to wait is to abide Gods time, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.8. The Jews ſate as a deſolate widow ſome hundreds of years before Chriſt, and above ſixteen hundred years ſince praying, that God would again build their temple; God's time is not yet come for them, now to wait is to hold out; hope is by ſome compared to a line, patience is nothing elſe but hope and faith drawn forth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A following God with fervent and unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant prayers, though he ſeem at preſent not to regard them; though he deal with us as he did with the Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.44. whoſe prayers could not paſs, yet to wait is to charge our ſelves ſtill to wait as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 62.1. <hi>My ſoul waiteth upon the Lord,</hi> and verſ. 5. of that <hi>Pſalm, My ſoul wait thou upon God;</hi> Though God do not as yet anſwer, yet to wait is never to ceaſe praying, till we find God anſwering; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſeeking as the ſpouſe did, till ſhe found him whom her ſoul loved. <hi>For this cauſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. ſays, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but to wait is to continue in prayer, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 69.3, 4, 5, 6. To be reſolv'd to take no denials like that poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe importunity nothing but the anſwer of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt could appeaſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22, 23, 24. and ſo on to verſ. 29. <hi>Or as blind Bartimeus, Mark</hi> 10.46. to verſ. 50.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A keeping cloſe to God in ways of duty, even when he ſeems to be furtheſt off from us in ways of mercy, a willingneſs rather no have our calamities continued, then our deliverance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46197:61"/>by means unwarrantable. Thus <hi>David</hi> though he had the promiſe of the Kingdom, and might at ſeveral times have gotten poſſeſſion thereof by the deſtruction of <hi>Saul:</hi> Yet he waits Gods time, and though it was for a Kingdom, he will not ſtep out of Gods way; and indeed we cannot be ſaid to wiat upon God, while we keep not in his Way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.34. <hi>Wait on the Lord and keep his way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.4, 5, 21. to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cchaſe deliverance from outward calamities, by ſinful means, is to deſtroy the ſoul to preſerve the body, or to make <hi>Gehezi</hi> his bargain, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his change of raiment had a curſe with it, 'Tis <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.2. <hi>ſay not thou I will recompence evil, but wait on the Lord, and he ſhall ſave thee,</hi> Iſa. 26.8. <hi>In the way of thy judgements have we waited for thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A diligent uſe of all means for the recovery of what we have loſt; the woman that had that bloody iſſue ſpent all ſhe had upon the Phyſicians; ſo ſhould we do our utmoſt in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By a through ſearch and ſcrutiny after thoſe ſins which have provoked God to hide his face from us, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways,</hi> &amp;c. Be ſure if there be any breach 'twixt God and us, it is of our own making; Hath God deprived us of former opportunities? Have not we been barren and unfruitful? Hath he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken much of former means and helps from us? Have not we undervalued thoſe mercies? We may many times read our ſin in our puniſhment, 'tis the promiſe of God , <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given, i. e.</hi> to him that improveth the mercies
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46197:61"/>and talents he hath; others are ſaid not to have what they have, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29. Hath God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed us with outward judgements? Have not we been wanton with thoſe mercies which God hath removed?</p>
            <p n="2">2. A zealous earneſtneſs in lamenting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe ſins, our turning unto God is the beſt means we can uſe to obtain his returning unto us; we are never more fit for mercy, then when we have reformed and caſt off thoſe ſins, which have deprived us of mercies, this is to lay the axe to the root of the tree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A preparing our ſelves for mercy; It may be we are not low enough, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. It may be we are not ſufficiently divorced from our former vanities, labour to remove all impediments, for be ſure, nothing but our own iniquities can keep back good things from us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the principles form whence this carriage ariſes. Take theſe few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An humble ſenſe of our own vileneſs, that if we enjoy never ſo little of theſe outward good things, we are leſs then the leaſt of all; if God be never ſo ſevere with us, there is much of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the higheſt acts of ſeverity, though we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much, all is little in compariſon of what we deſerve to ſuffer; while we have ſuch vile thoughts of our ſelves, we cannot but think well of God, and be ready to wait upon him; but ſo long as we think God harſh and rigorous, we are apt to ſay, as he did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Why ſhould we wait any longer for him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A through conviction of our being wholly at the will and pleaſure of God, if we enjoy any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46197:62"/>tokens of his love it is from his bounty; if theſe be removed, God herein is righteous; The very thoughts that all afflictions have been from God, have ſilenced all murmurings and repinings in believers of old; This was the Language of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Hezekiah, Good is the word of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 39.8. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not mymouth becauſe thou didſt it,</hi> ſays, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal</hi> 39.9. There may be miſcarriages in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments but none in God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſetled perſwaſion of our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for whatever help we need; whatever our diſtreſſes are, 'tis God alone can give eaſe; if he bind, who can looſe? If he caſt down, who can raiſe up? If he ſpeak trouble, who can ſpeak peace? He is the ſupreme and Sovereign diſpoſer of all things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. None can deliver out of his hands. Theſe perſwaſions engage us to wait upon God alone, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Reverent eſteem of the wiſdom, goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God in all his diſpenſations, that all his works are in weight and meaſure, and that he who hath the diſpoſal of all things does diſpoſe of all things, to the beſt, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not many times ſee theſe truths, becauſe the ways of God are ſo great a deep; Yet to believe it, is neceſſary to our waiting upon God, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good thoughts of him, what ever thoughts he ſeems to entertain concerning us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A reſignation of our ſelves into the hands of God, a ſubmitting our wills unto his, a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves down at his feet, that if God ſee it beſt both in reference to his glory, and our own good, that we ſhould rather honour him in away
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46197:62"/>of ſuffering than doing, to pray with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>If it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, not my will but thine be done,</hi> Mat. 26.39.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. What height of folly then is it, when God ſeems to caſt off all regard of us, for us to caſt off all regard of him: as do all impatient and froward perſons, who upon every withdrawing of God, are ſo bold as to call the glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven before their petty Tribunal; and charge him either with rigorouſneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs: as, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. And oh how apt are all men ſo far to forget their ſubjection and dependence upon God, as when he breaks in upon them by his judgments, they break out againſt him in their complaints and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings. Others there are who in their diſtreſſes betake themſelves to indiredct and ſinful means of ſafety, as the <hi>Jews</hi> here to their confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with the bordering Heathens. How many are there who think no courſe bad by which they may ſhift off dangers, and ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlves from an approaching Storm— But this is not to wait upon the Lord, but a courſe quite contrary to what is commended here. Now in theſe perilous times, leſt we ſhould make uſe of deceitful refuges, conſider theſe few Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The abſolute impoſſibility of ever finding benefit by any way of Sin. Sin is a depargting from God, and in departing from him, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſtrength and refuge. Can we ever be ſafe while we are from under Gods Protection? Sin is a putting our ſelves out of Gods Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <hi>The lord is with you while you are with him, but if you forſake him he will forſake you,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. Can any kind of means do us good without Gods concurrence? whatever there is of virtue in them, it is derived from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does Food nouriſh? 'tis God that makes it nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4. Does Phyſick cure? 'tis God that makes it effectual. Do Creature helps, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtand us in ſtead? 'tis God that gives them both hearts and power. To uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means is to blaſt means, and render them ineffectual. It's true that God ſometimes permits many to flouriſh not only in their ſinful courſes, but by their ſinful courſes. This was <hi>Aſaphs</hi> temptation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. But alas, much better would it have been for ſuch, rather to have been without their comforts than to have purchaſed them thus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This kind of carriage, in ſtead of relieving us in our diſtreſſes, does but increaſe them. Thoſe towards whom God hath any purpoſe of mercy, if gentler means prevail not, God, like a careful Phyſitian, applys ſharper: if mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er corrections do not humble them, like a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Parent, he is more ſevere: if cords of love will not draw them, he uſes the bonds of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; but if mercies move not, and afflictions prevail not, God takes another courſe with them and never leaves till he brings them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their knees. In natural cauſes reſiſtance does but increaſe the vigour and operation of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. When fire and water meet in ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, how does the ſtronger rage, till it hath got the victory. God tryed many ways with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46197:63"/>
               <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but his heart yielded not, God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over till he hath humbled him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16, 17. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. As for others, God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deals with them as he did with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who by his <hi>ſtubbornneſs</hi> encreaſed his Plagues; or elſe as he dealt at laſt with <hi>Ephraim</hi> Hoſ. 4.17. <hi>He gave him up to his incorrigibleneſs,</hi> either they haſten their ruine in this world by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, or elſe they ripen themſelves for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In ſtead of removeing or ſhortning our tryals, this carriage does prolong and continue tthem. The Chyrurgeon continues his Plaiſters while the Sore is unhealed: the Child does but prolong his Fathers diſpleaſure by his obſtinacy. A Prince that hath once begun to reduce rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Subjects, leaves not off till he hath ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: there's no ſtanding it out againſt God, no other way to prevail with him, but by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe Exhort.</hi> To follow the Prophets Example here, in taking the ſame courſe in this day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble, as he did in that: God had hid his face from <hi>Jacob</hi> then, he hath hid his face from <hi>Jacob</hi> now let us be perſuaded to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord to look for him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The recovery of thoſe pledges of Gods love, whereof we are at preſent deprived, is a mercyworthy th waiting for. Hath God hid his face from this Nation in general, by depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us in a great meaſure of the means of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf: remember how ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how refreſhing, how improving and ſtrengthning you have found thoſe Ordinances,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46197:64"/>of which you are at preſent in a great meaſure ſcanted, and yu cannot but be ſenſible that there are Priviledges worthy the waiting for. God hath exerciſed us in this Nation with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years of affliction, but what affliction ever like to this? hath God hid his face from any ſoul in particular? be perſuaded to wait, 'tis a mercy worthy the waiting for, to regain his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are no comforts in all the world like the comforts of Gods preſence: he that hath once taſted the ſweetneſs of theſe conforts, can not but comparatively deſpiſe all other, as in the primitive Chriſtians they deſpiſed eſtates, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Friends, yea and life it ſelf, rather than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ot any thing that might endanger Gods withdrawing from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis not the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e preſence and favour of God, but the evidence and ſence thereof, that renders our condition comfortable. In the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God is life, his loving kindneſs is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life; but while the ſoul hath its eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces blotted, its hopes darkned, the higer it pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the favour of God, the more afflicting is the inevidence thereof. Is God the fountain of all good? and is this God mine enemy? are all my freſh ſprings in him, and are all theſe ſtop'd and ſhut up againſt me? Is he the ſupreme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſer of all things, and am I under his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? that ſoul that conſiders what God is in himſelf, what he is to others of his ſervants, and what he hath been to it ſelf in times paſt, cannot but be ſenſible how grievous a thing it is to loſe ſuch a Friend, ſuch a Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46197:64"/>therefore eſteem the recovery of his favour a mery worthy the waiting for.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The unſafeneſs of this condition. Three things there are by which Experimental Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians find themſelves very much ſhaken in this world. 1. The Temptations of Satan, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making uſe of the allurements, ſometimes of the diſcouragements of this world: but the ſence of Gods love raiſes the ſoul into an holy indifferency about theſe things as ſmall matter. While the bird is upon the wing, all th gins and ſnares laid on the ground cannot intangle it: ſo it is with Souls while converſing with God. 2. Inward accuſations, when Satan and Conſcience joyn together in repreſenting to the Soul its Sins and Dangers: what amazement and horror do then take hold upon it if God hide his face. 3. Outward ſtreights and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions: but oh what an undaunted courage did the ſenſe of Gods love raiſe in the Martyrs of old; how did it cauſe them to contemn theſe things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. They gloryed in Tribulations, and accounted all the ſufferings of this life not worthy to be compared to the glory that ſhall be revealed: it is therefore in all theſe reſpects a Mercy worthy the wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The certainty of ſucceſs in this courſe: all other courſes are but the ſtruggling of the Wild Beaſt in the net, by which it is more entangled; but it is good for a man to wait, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 26. This hope makes not aſhamed. Rom. 5.5. <hi>Tis the promiſe of God that they that wait upon him ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.9. and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46197:65"/>what greater aſſurance aſſurance can we have than the Word of God; we build much ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of men, but the Word of God is ſure: Beſides, how exact and punctual hath God been in making good what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. When the time was expired of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> no ſooner was the four hundred and thirty years paſt but the ſelf ſame day he accompliſhes their promiſed deliverance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40, 41, 42. And as punctual was God in delivering his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Dan. 5.30. This was therefore <hi>Davids</hi> plea, Pſal. 102.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Zion, becauſe the time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may we diſcern when our ſet time for Deliverance is come?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though we have not ſuch clear and particular Revelations as his people of old had, yet have we ſuch general diſcoveries by which we may gueſs. 1. The lowneſs of his peoples condition; this was the argument prevailed with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.23, 24. their <hi>ſighs and crys</hi> under that ſore bondage: thus 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14 26, 27. <hi>the bitterneſs of their affliction.</hi> 2. The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their diſpoſiton, ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6.3. The rage and inſolency of their Adverſaries, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 22. theſe have uſually been prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks of deliverance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is the higheſt expreſſion of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and faithfulneſs, when God ſeemeth to be leaving us, for us to be unwilling to leave him, to wait upon God, and quiet our hearts by faith in his promiſes notwithſtanding all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46197:65"/>to believe in him when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee him this is the faith our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends; <hi>Thou believeſt becauſe thou haſt ſeen, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that believe and have not ſeen,</hi> Joh. 20.29. This was the excellency of <hi>Jobs</hi> faith, that it was ſo ſtedfaſt in cleaving to God, that nothing could unſettle it; <hi>though he kill me yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13.15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis for this end God many times hides his face, to exerciſe the ſait and patience of his people in waiting, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. God hath by his Spirit enriched the ſouls of his people with thoſe grace, as might qualify them for this carriage, and therefore he leads them by his providence into ſuch conditions as may exerciſe and call forth thoſe graces.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This kind of carrigage does not only very much conduce to our ſupport in theſe dark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, but to the ſweetning Gods return, when believers can ſay as God promiſes they ſhall ſay, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, and he will ſave us: this is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. There lies a greater obligation upon Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to this carriage, than upon any others: their profeſſions, their priviledges, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God hath made to them; their graces are all as ſo many obligations to wait.</p>
            <p n="7">7. How long hath God waited upon us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion, how many repulſes and deny. als have we given to all invitations; and after converſion how oft and how long hath God waited our returns from back-ſlidings? and yet
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46197:66"/>though God hath no other obligation upon him to wait for our good but only from his own goodneſs: there lies an obligation upon is by way of debt: beſides God cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by his returns to us, only we are there by made happy. In a word, if we <hi>wait</hi> upon God, God will ſtill <hi>wait</hi> upon us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. and give us cauſe to ſay, <hi>Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him: this is the Lord, we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation.</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46197:67"/>regard his Soul was ſo large, and his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo extenſive, he was not long reſident in any particular place, and therefore he was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to depute others to water that ſeed he had planted, and to carry on that good work that he had begun: and upon this account it was that he writes both his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. and upon this account he here writes to <hi>Titus</hi> Chapter 1. ver. 5. <hi>Titus</hi> was by birth a Grecian of the ſtock of the Gentiles, and after his Converſion was a conſtant Companion and Fellow-labourer with this great Apoſtle, and was much imployed by him in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The great Work that he aimed at in writing this Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> you find in one general word expreſt, it was, <hi>to ſet in order thoſe things that were wanting,</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 5. and to direct him in the management of that moſt important affair of the Church.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter you have ſeveral duties which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Titus</hi> in charge, that he ſhould be a faithful remembrancer to thoſe <hi>Cretians,</hi> which duties are many and divers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſpeaks of thoſe duties that concern ſome particular Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of thoſe that concern all Chriſtians in Common.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that concern particular Chriſtians are, Men and Women, Young and Old, Maſters and Servants: as you have it in the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>But ſpeak thou the things which become ſound Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then he ſpeaks to young Perſons, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46197:67"/>
               <hi>Young men likewiſe exhort to be ſober minded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he counſels <hi>Titus</hi> to ſhew them his own Example, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>In all things ſhew thy ſelf a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo he deſcends to the meaneſt degree of Chriſtians; and that is to Servants; Servants were then of a more vile and abject condition than houſhould Servants are now among us: Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were then ſlaves, their perſons and lives were at the wills of their Maſters: and becauſe their condition was ſuch, they had little comfort from things here below, and therefore takes care of them; and this ſhews the greatneſs of the Apoſtles care in inſtructing them how they may live cmfortably; and to eneourage them, ha tells them, <hi>they ſhould be obedient to their own Maſters, and to pleaſe them well in all things, not anſwering again, not purloyning, but ſhewing all good fidelity:</hi> The reaſon he gives is this, <hi>That they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> Some reckon this laſt clauſe under the duties which concern all Chriſtians incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; but it is alledged here with particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Servants, and for that there are two Reaſons given: Becauſe the duties here preſt upon Servants were duties to which they were very much averſe by the harſhneſs or anſterenes of their Maſters, who had ſuch power over them beyond or above what is uſed by us, and what Chriſtians all along ſince have had. Now they were under danger of thoſe ſins <hi>that</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them from, as <hi>purloyning from them,</hi> &amp;c. And to encourage them, he tells them, though your condition be never ſo mean, though you are ſo contemptible in the ſight of men, yet by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46197:68"/>your good carriage you may be acceptable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the ſight of God, you are not in ſo low a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city but you are capable <hi>of adorning the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi> Now though this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be of greater latitude than to Servants, yet it is ſpoken to them upon this account, becauſe they had little hopes of finding acceptance with God, ſince they were under ſuch auſterity to their own Maſters. Now if they, how much more ſhould others <hi>adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words are theſe two particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A deſcription of the Goſpel,</hi> it isthe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God, that ſpeaks it to be of Divine Authority; and it is ſaid to be the Doctrine of God our Saviour, and that ſpeaks its gracious deſignation in order to the ſaving of loſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and you find it more fully expreſſed in the next Verſe, <hi>For the Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation hath appeared, &amp;c.</hi> The Grace of God in afording his Goſpel, it brings Salvation, that is in the tenders and proffers, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way how we may attain it. This is a high commendation given of the Goſpel, it is <hi>the Doctrine of God, and of God our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is a declaration of their duty to whom this Doctrine comes, to whom God hath been ſo gracious as to vouchſafe his Goſpel, they muſt adorn it, that is, render it lovely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and amiable to others; they muſt carry themſelves ſo as to give no occaſion to others of ſtumbling, or taking offence by their miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; they muſt ſo live as not to give occaſion to others to think the Goſpel hath no more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46197:68"/>than humane Rules and Reaſon hath, This duty is mentioned in a two-fold extent, that they and all they (not only Servants but others to whom this Doctrine comes) ſhould adorn the Goſpel, and that they may adorn the Goſpel in all things, in every branch and part of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Doctrines I ſhall commend to you from the words:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doct. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is not meerly man but really God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Goſpel here is ſaid to be the Doctrine of God; and this we finde is the ordinary Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wherein the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt (at leaſt it is the familiar Language) <hi>Titus</hi> 1.3. <hi>According to the Commandment of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;</hi> he is called there God our Saviour: and in the <hi>13th verſe</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>Looking for the bleſſed hope and gloriour appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> have been very buſie in gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeveral Scriptures wherein the word <hi>Eloah</hi> and <hi>Elohim</hi> (wherein the ſingular number is put for the plural (are aſcribed to Creatures; there are two places eſpecially inſiſted on, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.1. God tells <hi>Moſes, I have made thee a God to Pha</hi>) <hi>raoh</hi> The other is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are Gods,</hi> ſpeaking of Magiſtrates and Princes, and the great Ones of the world, thoſe that are in the higheſt Rank of men; their deſign here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is to weaken the faith of Chriſtians concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divinity of Chriſt. In anſwer to theſe two Scriptures it is obſerved by many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writers, though the Name of God be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46197:69"/>aſcribed to Magiſtrates and great Ones in the world more than once or twice, yet is this Title never given to them but with ſome reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and diminution; and therefore in both thoſe Scriptures before quoted, it is not ſaid fimply, <hi>I will make thee a God to Pharaoh;</hi> but he ſpeaks of the reverence and eſteem that he ſhould finde from <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and thus it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.16. God tells <hi>Moſes, Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron ſhould be to him inſtead of a mouth, and he ſhould be inſtead of God. Aaron</hi> is not ſimply, but <hi>inſtead,</hi> to denote his Authority in giving his Command and Orders. So for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods;</hi> but in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. you have this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, <hi>You ſhall die like men.</hi> But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, the Name of God is uſually given to Chriſt with ſome augmentative Epithite; and truly that Chriſt is truly God, it is one great foundation of all our faith and hope, and I ſhall clcar it briefly by theſe Arguments:</p>
            <p n="1">1. He whom the Scriptures doth not only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with the Name of God, but with thoſe additional Epithites which no Creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of but God, muſt needs be God, and not meer man; Thus in reſpect of Jeſus Chriſt, God hath honoured him not only with this Name, but with many additional Titles: He is ſaid, <hi>to be God equal with the Father:</hi> Phil. 2.6. <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titus</hi> 2.13. He is ſtiled, <hi>The Great God; and the true God.</hi> 1 Epiſt. St. <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>And we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Christ: This is the true God, and eternal life.</hi> The true God is to be taken in oppoſition to all Idol-Gods,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46197:69"/>and all thoſe Metaphorical expreſſions, where we finde this Name <hi>Elohim</hi> (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) given to Creatures.</p>
            <p>Again, he is ſtiled, <hi>The Mighty God,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. <hi>For unto us a Child is born, his Name ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wonderful, Councellour, the Mighty God.</hi>

            <p>He is called, <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom, 9.5. <hi>Whoſe are the Fathers</hi> (ſpeaking of the Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Jews) <hi>and of whom concerning the fleſh Chriſt came, who is God bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is ſtiled alſo, <hi>The Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. <hi>Which none of the Princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> which throughout all the Scripture is not ſo much as ſingly aſcribed to any Creature, is aſcribed to Jeſus Chriſt; He is called, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs, Jehovah our Righteouſneſs:</hi> That is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He in whom are all thoſe high and eminent perfections, thoſe glorious Attributes which tranſcend the capacity of any Creature, muſt needs be God; and theſe the Scripture aſcribes to Chriſt. I ſhall only give you ſome few hints.</p>
            <p>He who is Omnipotent, whoſe Power is boundleſs and unlimited, whoſe Government reacheth Heaven and Earth, He that can do all things muſt needs be God.</p>
            <p>Take all the Power that is in the Creature, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> confinement and limitation of their Power; but Jeſus Chriſt is Almighty, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the Almighty.</hi> Rev. 19.6. <hi>The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</hi> 'Tis true, Angels do excel in Power, but Omnipotencie is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46197:70"/>peculiar to the true God; for they are but his Creatures, and their power is limited by him, they are his Meſſengers whom he imploys.</p>
            <p>Again, Omniſciencie, this is aſcribed to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He ſearcheth hearts, and tryeth reins;</hi> he hath a window open into all mens breaſts, and diſcovers what is their thoughts, he needs not that any ſhould tell him any thing, becauſe he knows it, and therefore he muſt needs be God, <hi>John</hi> 2.25. <hi>And he needed not that any ſhould te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of man, for he knew what was in man,</hi> that is, <hi>as he is God, John</hi> 13.19. He that knoweth all things before they come to paſs muſt needs be God. <hi>Now I tell you</hi> (ſays he) <hi>before it come, that when it is come to paſs, you muſt believe that I am he;</hi> believe him to be God.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Now this is only peculiar to the great God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is ſaid to be Omnipreſent, He was in Heaven, even while he was upon the Earth, <hi>John</hi> 14.3. <hi>I go, that where I am ye may be alſo:</hi> He was on Earth, but as God He was even then in Heaven. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. His promiſe to his Diſciples is, <hi>And loe I am with you always, to the end of the world;</hi> and ſo he is as God, He is with them while he is in Heaven. As Ubiquity is only peculiar to the great God, he fills Heaven and earth with his preſence; for the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him: Now I will be with you when I am taken up from you, when you cannot ſee me, nor converſe in the fleſh with me any longer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Immutability and Eternity are aſcribed to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46197:70"/>Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. it is applied to him who is the Wiſdom ſpoken of there principally, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old:</hi> ver. 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>I was ſet up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the Earth was,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This ſhews that Jeſus Chriſt was Anteceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to all Creatures, and that ſpeaks him to be Eternal: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>Before the Mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt formed the Earth and the World, even from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, thou art God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So everlaſting is peculiar to God which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to Chriſt, <hi>Micha</hi> 5.2. <hi>Whoſe goings forth have been from of Old, from everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Margent reads it, <hi>From the days of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yesterday and to day, and for ever.</hi> It is ſaid of him, <hi>There is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of changing;</hi> and he is called, <hi>The everlaſting Father, Iſa.</hi> 9.6.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He that hath life in Himſelf, and is the Principle of life to others muſt needs be God. It is a Contradiction to be a Creature and to be ſelf-Originated. So is it ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.15. <hi>And killed the Prince of Life.</hi> v. 16. <hi>And his Name, through Faith in his Name, hath made this man ſtrong;</hi> that ſhews the greatneſs of his power, <hi>through faith in his Name. John</hi> 5.26. <hi>For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He to whom works of Infiniteneſs are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed muſt needs be God. No Creature can poſſibly do any act of Infiniteneſs, becauſe it is above the rank of a Creature.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:46197:71"/>
            <p>The work of Creation, which is a work of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs is aſcribed to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the work of Supportation is aſcribed to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the Word of his power.</hi> He that not onely brought all things out of nothing by the Word of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but he that upholds them from falling back into their firſt nothing again, by the ſame All-mighty power, muſt needs be God; and this is aſcribed to Chriſt. So the work of Redemption, this is attributed to <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> He that could ſubdue him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil; He that could conquer Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallities and Powers, and lead Captivity cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; He to whom all things are made ſubject both in Heaven and in Earth, Principallities, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Thrones, and every thing that is named, that is, every thing that is excellent, are made ſubject to him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet,</hi> and hath left nothing unſubdued, <hi>and gave him to be Head over all things to the Church;</hi> That is the third Argument.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He whom Angels adore and Creatures worſhip muſt needs be God; and thus they do Jeſus Chriſt: God is very jealous of his own Honour and will not ſuffer them to be given to any other: But honour and worſhip is by the Command of God to be given to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> And we are baptized in the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. And we are bound to pray in the Name of Chriſt; <hi>Whatever you ask in my Name, that will I do,</hi> John 14.13. And to believe in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46197:71"/>Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God believe alſo in me.</hi> Now to believe in any thing is to make a God of it; weare taken off from ſetting our faith on any Creature: <hi>Truſt not in man, nor in the Son of man:</hi> and, <hi>curſed is he that maketh an arm of fleſh his ſtrength,</hi> that puts his confidence in any Creature.</p>
            <p>In a Word, all the Glory that belongs to the Father, the Father hath commanded us to give to his Son; That all might honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.23. <hi>That all ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father.</hi> So much for this Doctrine: I ſhall apply it under the next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. <hi>That as Jeſus Chriſt is truly God; this God is the Saviour of loſt Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a Saviour to all that do partake of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: there is no other Saviour but only Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Doctrine of God our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 2.10 <hi>According to the Commandment of God our Savior, Tit.</hi> 1.3. You have it ſeveral times in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. It was under this Name that the Angels (as Heralds) from Heaven did proclaim his Incarnation, <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> Now a Saviour implies a ſtate of miſery; it ſuppoſeth either ſome miſery that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the preſent, or ſome danger that we are liable to for the future; &amp; in both theſe reſpects all the Children of men do ſtand in need of a Savior. We are Apoſtate Creatures, &amp; have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our ſelves not only into a ſtate of eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God, but we have inveſted our ſelves with enmity againſt God. Now this Condition
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46197:72"/>muſt needs be a periſhing Condition: for, <hi>if the favour of God be better than life,</hi> then the anger and diſpleaſure of God is more dreadful than death it ſelf. This is the puniſhment of the damned: it is expreſſed by this as the moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant part of their miſery, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed.</hi> Mat. 25.4. <hi>(Ye curſed)</hi> There is hell enough in that one word, leaving out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as we are under great danger we have need of a Saviour; now there is no other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour but Jeſus Chriſt: He is ſaid to be <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men,</hi> that is, of all that are ſaved. Of <hi>all men,</hi> not that every individual perſon ſhall be ſaved, or was intended to be ſaved by the condeſcention of Chriſt, but he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all men, whether Jew or Gentile; for Salvation of Old was reſtrained to the people of the Jews, as to the means; and we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe as to the effect, for there is no Salvation without Chriſt, <hi>other Foundation can no man lay,</hi> 1 Cor. 3 11. For the opening of this I ſhall ſpeak briefly to three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From what it is that Chriſt ſaves.</item>
               <item>2. Whom it is that he ſaves.</item>
               <item>3. How it that he accompliſheth this work of Salvation.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. From what it is Chriſt ſaves. He ſaves in general from every thing that is dreadful, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that doth endanger the ſafety and well being of Souls to all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſaves from Satan the worſt of Enemies, he hath trampled upon Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and led them captive.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:46197:72"/>
            <p>Object. <hi>But are not the people of God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moleſted and diſquieted by Satan; is not he as a roaring Lyon going up and down ſeeking whom he may devour, or at leaſt whom he may diſquiet and diſturb?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, He ſaves indeed from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan though not as a Tempter, yet as a Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he may diſturb their peace, and diſquiet them in their courſe, but he can never bring them back again to himſelf. <hi>For greater is he that is in you, that he that is in the world.</hi> Fear not, little Children, though you have to do with <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers,</hi> with enemies more than your match, yet <hi>greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. My Father is greater than all;</hi> he hath you in his hand, and he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to the care of his Son; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is greater than all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaves from the wrath of God, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Judgments. To eſcape the wrath of God is the concern of all fallen Creatures: <hi>Oh Generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come.</hi> There is no wrath like the wrath of God, nor any wrath from God like that which is to come: and the firſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Goſpel wherever it comes, warns to flee from the wrath to come. Now by this Salvation Chriſt ſets his People free from the wrath of God which is to come. That God whom they have made their enemy, he makes to be their friend; that God whom they have ſet againſt them, he procures to be for them. True, the people of God may be under a ſenſe of his wrath, and in their ſad thoughts may
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46197:73"/>pray as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Correct me not in thy hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:</hi> yet they are free from the wrath of God as a Judge, though not from the anger of God as a Father. Though God will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, and caſt them off; yet God may afflict and chaſtiſe them; and that is their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtiſeſt and inſtructeſt him out of thy Law.</hi> We ſtand in need of Afflictions, and thoſe afflictions are ſo far from being an argument of Gods wrath, that they are the fruit of his care for, and love to us. Every Son whom he loves he chaſtens. God cannot be content to ſee them that he loves go on in a courſe that is apparently tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own ruine, and therefore he ſteps and checks them by many ſharp correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſaves from Afflictions ſo far as they they may be to their prejudice: <hi>For a little time if need be, ye are in heavineſs, through manifold temptations,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>For a little time, and if need be.</hi> So ſooner nor no longer, nor any more of affliction than the ſtate and condition of their Souls need.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſaves from ſin, the worſt of evils; this is the great Tyrant that uſurps it over the Souls of all the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi> He ſaves them from the power of ſin, he ſaves them from the guilt of ſin; though he doth not ſave them from the very preſence of ſin; it may afflict and diſquiet them, but it ſhall not ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſaves from death it ſelf, which is the King of Terrors, from the ſting of Death,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46197:73"/>though not from the Grave and rottenneſs. The nature of Death is altered to all true Believers. Chriſt hath taken away that was at firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a curſe; ſo that in ſubſtance all that was as a curſe is turned into a bleſſing to all that Chriſt takes care of. So much for the firſt, from what Chriſt ſaves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, who are the perſons whom Chriſt ſaves, we ſhall not look upon that Salvation which Chriſt bought out for the world to be of that vaſt latitude as to extend to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and individual perſon in the world, for that is contrary to the whole ſtrain of the Scriptures: Do but conſider that in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh. (Whoſoever believeth in him.)</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer, and none elſe but Believers; all that are ſuch, and none but ſuch. For, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> So when the Goaler comes trembling before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> and cryed out, <hi>Sirs, what must I do to be ſaved? Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe.</hi> An Unbeliever is one that rejects that Salvation that the Goſpel tenders and that Chriſt hath purchaſed. An Unbeliever he is in a ſtate of condemnation, he is condemned already. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe general expreſſions in the Scripture of Chriſts dying for the whole world, are to be underſtood only in oppoſition to the Nation of the Jews who were God's peculiar people, and to whom all God's ſaving mercies wereof old confined.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How it is that Chriſt ſaves. He
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46197:74"/>ſaves as a Captain, by Conqueſt, ſubduing the ſtrong man armed, under whoſe power we were held Captive: The ſtrong man armed keeps poſſeſſion of us till a ſtronger than he caſts him out, and comes and binds him, and overcomes him: and this Chriſt hath done in Conquering Principalities and Powers; and thus he ſaves not only from the power of the Devil) for we were perfectly under the power of Sathan) thus he breaks off that yoke.</p>
            <p>But then he ſaves as a Prieſt, by making ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. He ſaves from offended Juſtice; we all of us are not only captive to Sathan, but Priſoners and Debtors to Divine Juſtice. Now Chriſt ſaves his people from this, by offering himſelf for his people once for all; and ſo this Salvation is not only a negative buſineſs in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from thoſe miſeries that we lie under, but poſitive in intitling us to all thoſe bleſſings and priviledges of which we are capable; <hi>Thoſe he hath purchaſed by his Blood,</hi> Act. 20.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Applic.</hi> 1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Then this may inform us, that if Chriſt be the God and Saviour, upon what a ſure foundation is the faith and hope of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers built; it is not upon the ſand, but upon a Rock. How many falſe foundations do men build their hopes upon; theſe may ſtand them inſtead for a time, but when the wind riſes, and the rain deſcends, and the floods flow in upon them, they will fall, and their fall will be very great. None but a God could poſſibly have gone through ſo great an undertaking. We had made our ſelves Debtors to an Infinite Majeſty, and our Debts were ſuch as could not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46197:74"/>but by an infinite expiation. Our Saviour takes all upon him when he came to be the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his people, to take upon him all their Debts and to diſcharge them. None but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perſon was fit for ſuch a work. This is the Character that the Scripture gives of Chriſt, as one who is able and mighty to ſave; yea, to ſave to the uttermoſt: <hi>Our Redeemer is the Lord of Host, the Holy One of Iſrael is his Name.</hi> If our Saviour be God, then this is matter of great encouragement to fly to him, let our caſe be never ſo difficult, perplexed and hopeleſs, yet as he is God, it cannot exceed his power to redeem and deliver, <hi>Only believe and thou ſhalt ſee the Salvation of God,</hi> Matth. 8. The poor Leper came to our Saviour (his was ſuch as he could not go to men, he was ſhut out from the Congregation) <hi>and worſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean:</hi> You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine a caſe to be more ſad than the caſe of the Lepers was, and yet his faith did bring him to Jeſus Chriſt, and it was his comming Chriw that did obtain his Cure, even of that diſtemper. O! therefore, how ſhould this comfort us againſt the greateſt of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies. Our Corruptions, though they are never ſo ſtrong, our oppoſitions though never ſo mighty; though Principalities and Powers be engaged againſt us, though earth and hell be up in arms againſt us, yet this anſwers all, our Saviour is God, all things therefore are ſubject to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Of Exhortation, Be perſwaded then to fly to this God in all your diſtreſſes; and comfort your ſelves by placing all your hopes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46197:75"/>upon him. God hath made many diſcoveries of the Glory of his Son hereafter. <hi>He ſhall appear without ſin to Salvation:</hi> he appeared the firſt time as our ſurety to pay our Debts, but he ſhall appear the 2d time as one that hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſcharged that Debt, and ſit down on the right hand of his Father in Glory: he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt time as a ſheep for the ſlaughter, he ſhall appear the ſecond time as a Conqueror, trampling upon all his enemies: He appeared the firſt time in meanneſs: He ſhall appear the ſecond time in Majeſty. We ſhould comfort our ſelves in the hopes that we have in ſuch a Saviour, who is truly God. Whatever the afflictions and diſtreſſes of Gods people may be, yet he will work out enlargement for them; he can do it, and he hath promiſed to do it; Yea, he hath undertaken to do it: if you do but on the one ſide put into the ballance all your doubts, fears, and Objections; and on the other ſide, do but think who it is that hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken your Redemption and Salvation remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring it is God your Saviour, this one word will weigh down all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, This may be a uſe of terror to all the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt is God, and therefore he is too great for them to cope with: <hi>His enemies ſhall ſurely become his footſtocl;</hi> and then ſhall he reſign his Kingdom unto his Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. He is too great to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and he will certainly conquer his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, though it be in ſuch a way many times, as does ſtagger the Faith of poor his Creatures.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:46197:75"/>
            <p>Doctr. 3. <hi>That the Goſpel is the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle mentions this two-fold excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the Author of the Goſpel, that he might (as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t were) with a two-fold cord bind us to a greater heedfulneſs of its Counſels, and to a more ſtrickt obſervation of its Rules. Our hearts are loſe and ſlippery, eſpecially to thoſe things that concern our Souls: and it is not a ſingle cord that will keep us within compaſs, and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of the Goſpel as the Doctrine of him who is our God and Saviour. In this deſcription of the Author, he ſpeaks enough to work upon all our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at once: It is the Doctrine of God, and therefore it is not to be ſlighted. The Kings &amp; great Ones of the World are in nothing ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of as their Laws, they will not endure them to be trampled upon, and deſpiſed by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Oh! think what a vaſt difference there is between the great God and the higheſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates that are here upon the earth; his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is over all, over all men, over all the Conſciences of men (which no Prince can claim Dominion over) in this regard, as it is the Doctrine of God, therefore it is to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obeyed: every Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath the ſtamp of Gods Authority upon it. Now is it ſafe to fall under the diſpleaſure of God to make him our enemy by breaking his Laws? By theſe two Characters that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives of the Author of the Goſpel, he would work upon our fear and love: Theſe 2 are the principal affections in the Soul, which will
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46197:76"/>ingage all our endeavors of what kind ſoever they be. He is God and therefore muſt not be ſlighted, for he can cruſh us as a moth; it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to fall under his diſpleaſure: Now as the Goſpel is the Doctrine of God, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands awe and reverence from all that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. It commands our watchfulneſs, that we do not wander from it; it commands our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſtir up all our endeavours to obey it.</p>
            <p>And then it is not only <hi>the Doctrine of God, but of God our Saviour;</hi> and hereby he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our love and ingenuity. The whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Doctrine of the Goſpel is Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He hath in the Goſpel diſcovered himſelf Doctrinally to be a Saviour.</p>
            <p>The whole ſum of the Goſpel is reduced to theſe ſix Heads, as to the ſcope and deſign of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To convince men of their own miſery; this you have as the proper work of the Spirit; when he ſets home the Goſpel, <hi>He ſhall convince the world of ſin.</hi> Men are apt to think that their condition is not ſo ſad and miſerable as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is, they looking upon it as nature repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it to them: but the Goſpel ſhews them, that they are utterly loſt and undone in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Goſpel lets them know the way of recovery; though they are miſerable at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet it acquaints them notwithſtanding their miſery that they may be happy: and that is the ſecond work of the Spirit, not only <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of ſin, but alſo of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third deſign of the Goſpel is, to direct us what way, means and courſe we ſhould take
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46197:76"/>to put our ſelves in a capacity for the obtaining of this happineſs, and that is by Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. That there is happineſs to be had for poor miſerable and undone Creatures by Jeſus Chriſt, but it is only by Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Goſpel is an invitation to accept of Chriſt and of Salvation upon ſuch terms, againſt which none can juſtly except: It is but to leave our ſins, our burdens, which is our priviledge to leave. Our Saviour left Heaven and happineſs for us, and we leave nothing but our bonds and fetters, and ſickneſſes for him, this is all that he requires.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The deſign of the Goſpel is to remove all Diſcouragements, and take away all Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which may make us ſhie of coming to Chriſt: we are loſt Creatures, unable to repent and believe: there may be mercy and pardon had upon condition of Faith and Repentance, but both theſe are gifts of God: now God hath promiſed to give both theſe to them that ſeek him for them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In a word, the deſign of the Goſpel is, (if it do not gain our Souls to Jeſus Chriſt for their Salvation) to leave them more inexcuſable as to Condemnation, to ſtop their mouths, and to leave them under ſtronger Convictions, that the blood of their Souls may lie upon themſelves. So that all Goſpel Revelations and diſcoveries center in this deſign, Mans Salvation. If there be any ſo ſtupid yet, (notwithſtanding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Chriſt, which may make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed) they muſt needs be ſtocks and ſtones, and more ſtupid than the earth they tread
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46197:77"/>upon: whom neither the Miniſters of God, nor mercies, nor ſeverities will awaken, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their ears to inſtruction: all the truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel have a natural tendencie to, and center in this one deſign, even the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of loſt Creatures.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine conſiſts of two parts:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>That the Gospel is the Doctrine of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>And the Gospel is the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak to each of them a little diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Goſpel cannot be any other than the Doctrine of God, becauſe it is an abreviation of the manifold wiſdom of God, wherewith the Womb of his Counſels and Decrees were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling before the Foundations of the World were laid: it was the contrivance of no other Wiſdom than that of God: There are two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe intrinſick Arguments that may be drawn from the Nature of the Goſpel; for there are many impreſſions of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the Goſpel it ſelf, both as to the matter and ſeveral parts of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider that it carries in it ſome impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Divine Majeſty in thoſe deep and myſterious Truths that are therein revealed, which (when they are revealed) do exceed the capacity of any created underſtanding to reach, and therefore they muſt needs much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the capacity of any created underſtanding to find out. God hath in his Goſpel revealed ſuch things as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46197:77"/>can the heart of man conceive.</hi> Theſe are ſuch abſtruſe things that they could have no other Author but God himſelf; That God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man; that the Lord of all things ſhould take upon him the form of a Servant; that he that knew no ſin ſhould be made ſin. That guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Creatures ſhould be ſaved by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another, when they had no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own. Theſe are all Riddles and Myſteries, theſe are truths that have had many oppoſers: and therefore they have had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oppoſers, becauſe they are ſo much above reach of Reaſon. Now the excellencie of the Goſpel appears in this, becauſe the truths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in revealed are ſo ſublime and myſterious, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controverſie great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From that exactneſs of holineſs the Goſpel requires. All the Books of Philoſophers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that preſcribe holineſs, are many of them unſound, and all of them put together defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. True, the Maſters of them (the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons among the Philoſophers) have many flowers in their Gardens, but withal they have many weeds. But the Goſpel is a Garden wherein there is no weeds; there is no kind of defect in thoſe Flowers that you meet with there; all defects are made up. If I ſhould propound to you the ſeveral rules both of the Platonical, and Stoical Philoſophers, many things (it is true) are commendable in them, but all are mixt, and all put together are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; they are no compleat Rule: But the Goſpel of Chriſt, you finde in <hi>Titus</hi> 2.12. <hi>It teacheth us to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46197:78"/>luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this perſent world.</hi> Theſe three expreſſions amount higher than all the Rules that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by men. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> It implies a ſimilitude but non an equality, that is impoſſible; an univerſality of holineſs, but not an equality. So in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, pure, lovely, of good report, think on theſe trings.</hi> How? to make them your great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Goſpel of Chriſt is higher in its precepts than all other Rules than ever were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is larger in its extent, it reacheth not only the outward but inward man which no humane Laws can reach. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>he had never known ſin but by the Law of God,</hi> Rom. 7. Now this ſhews it is from God, becauſe it reacheth the heart and Conſcience. To abhor an unjuſt act, or an act of violence comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Rules of Moral Philoſophers; but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the thoughts of any thing that is evil, is proper only to the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Arguments by which the Goſpel preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this exactneſs of holineſs: No man did either promiſe or threaten ſuch things as God in the Goſpel does. Princes may threaten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pain of their high diſpleaſure, but God threatens upon pain of everlaſting ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Princes may threaten what evils are within the reach of their power, in caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to their Laws and Government; but God threatens like himſelf, like a God. So the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46197:78"/>Promiſes are ſuch as none but God can make; the Promiſe of everlaſting happineſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. To how many diſpoſitions our Saviour hath promiſed bleſſedneſs. Now bleſſedneſs is in the power of none to beſtow upon us, but on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in that God who is in himſelf bleſſed, and who is the Author of that happineſs his Creatures are capable of. By all this it appears evidently, that the Goſpel can be no ther than the Goſpel of God; he who cannot only ruine the body, but whoſe power reach the Soul, that can make it happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all eternity; and that propounds threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and promiſes ſutable to a ſtate after this life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The diſcoveries the Goſpel makes of the worth of our Souls: all men are very intent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the concerns of their bodies; if they be ſick, the Phyſitian muſt be ſent for, no means ſhall be neglected, but all courſes uſed to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from under their ſickneſs: but their Soul concerns are things that moſt men little look after. Now there is nothing that does ſo convince us of the worth of our Souls as the Goſpel doth; that tells us, that Jeſus Chriſt thought them worth the laying down his life for, the ſhedding of his precious blood for; and God thought them of that valu, that he did not ſpare his only Son, but gave him to die for them, there is no ſuch Argument to convince us of the excellencie of our Souls as Goſpel-Arguments are.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider the terms upon which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel propounds recovery and happineſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46197:79"/>to loſt Creatures; they are ſuch as are moſt conſiſtant with Reaſon: But what are thoſe terms? Repentance and Faith. The terms that others propound are vaſtly wide and different from theſe, but Repentance and Faith have the cleareſt evidence of Reaſon above all other terms whatſoever. In the Sinners recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to the great God, without Repentance, what plea can ſinners make to God, but only that they may provoke God to with-hold every thing of mercy from them; without Repentance to come to God &amp; to beg pardon, it is but to ask leave to ſin againſt God afreſh, and to go on in thoſe ways and courſes that are highly offenſive to him. And ſo for Faith, this alſo carries the cleareſt evidene of Reaſon with it; for poor Creatures that have offended an infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, for them to expect mercy from that God whom they have offended. Now the Goſpel tells us of a ſufficient price, equivalent, nay more than an equivalent price, and ſatisfaction for all offences &amp; injuries done to Divine Juſtice. If we by faith lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, by ſuch a faith as doth intitle us to him, it may be well with us both here and for ever; but other terms and conditions (as the Popiſh penances, and voluntary humilities, and mortifications, and the like) what are they if they were ten thouſand times more than any Creature can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in point of compenſation to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? Alas! they are nothing: it is only by Jeſus Chriſt that we can be aceepted, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction can be made to Gods Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſtrange kind of efficacie that this
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46197:79"/>word hath upon the Souls of ſinners; how doth it amaze and affright, and alter and change them? How doth it make them new Creatures? then when God concurs with it by his Spirit, <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. but it is by the Spirit of God; what a mighty change doth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel make upon the hearts of ſinners when the Spirit of God goeth along with it: to give you ſome inſtances of it, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> of a covetous perſon became a ſelf-denyer and makes reſtitution to the full, even to fourfold. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> who was poſſeſſed with ſo many Devils, what an eminent Saint did ſhe become afterwards? So St. <hi>Paul</hi> of an enraged Perſecuter, what an eminent Apoſtle did the Goſpel make him to be, when it came to him in power? They who have delighted like ſo many ſwine to wallow in the mire of their luſts, have had their frames and tempers ſo altered, that nothing is delightful and pleaſing to them but thoſe ſpiritual Comforts and Enjoyments againſt which they have had the greateſt enmity in their former inclinations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall prove this by ſome Arguments, that the Goſpel is the Doctrine of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Goſpel ſhould meet with any acceptance in the world. For what is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel? It is a Doctrine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to humane Reaſon, and croſs to humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and our worldly and natural inclinations. One would think it a ſtrange thing, if a man ſhould go about to perſuade a rich man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor, and graet men to become low and mean, and thoſe that flouriſh in the world to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46197:80"/>caſt off the world, you would think this Goſpel ſhould never meet with any entertainment from men that have their wits about them. Now ſuch is the Doctrine of Chriſt, and yet it hath done all this. St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and ſeveral of the Apoſtles were in a gainful &amp; thriving courſe for a livelihood (as to this world) in a proſperous condition, but they renounced and <hi>left all and followed Chriſt;</hi> others there were who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in curious Arts, <hi>who came and burnt their Books.</hi> Now to part with thoſe things that are ſo pleaſing to nature, and to entertain the Goſpel which croſſeth all our natural inclinations, muſt needs be diſtaſteful and unacceptable to fleſh and blood; this proves it to be of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Goſpel ſhould make ſo great a progreſs in the world though it hath been oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and perſecuted, though it hath met with multitudes of enemies, though the earth &amp; hell have been ſet againſt it, yet that it hath gained upon its adverſaries, it ſhould ſtill prevail, it is an argument that it is of God, that it ſhould be preſerved ſo long, conſidering the attempts of its enemies againſt it. It was notable Counſel that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> gave the Jewiſh Councel who were met together to take councel againſt <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, to take ſome ſpeedy courſe for the ruining of their Perſons, and the obſtructing of their Doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.38. <hi>Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone, for if this counſel, or this work be of men it will come to nought, but if it be of God you cannot overthrow it.</hi> Now this is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that this Goſpel is of God, that it hath had ſo many enemies and oppoſers, and yet it hath
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46197:80"/>been preſerved &amp; proſpers, &amp; got ground of its enemies. How have all <hi>Dagons</hi> fallen before this Art: Great is Truth and it ſhall prevail.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That poor Creatures ſhould be ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and ſupported as to bear Teſtimony to the truth of it: as to part with their eſtates, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and lives, and all dear to them, and that with ſo much courage, and chearfulneſs, and that by ſuch means the Goſpel ſhould thrive, which have been uſed to ſuppreſs it.</p>
            <p>I grant that men under their miſtakes may be very conſident and bold, even to the ſuffering of death for them; but they have wanted rhoſe heights of comforts and thoſe raptures of joy, which the ſuffering people of God have met with in their ſufferings, which cannot be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in any kind of Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond branch of the Doctrine is this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is the Doctrine of God, <hi>our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every thing of the Goſpel enters in and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels at this as its deſign, mans Salvation. I ſhall mention three things to clear this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is nothing that diſcovers ſin to be ſo odious and abominable, ſo hateful to God, ſo deſtructive to us, and ſo dangerous a thing to us as the Goſpel; its odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appears by its hatefulneſs to God, and by the price which our Saviour paid when hetook upon him his peoples ſins; it coſt him his blood and thoſe agonies and pains that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed how great they were: now the glaſs of the Law preſents ſin very dangerous, but the glaſs of the Goſpel much more dangerous.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46197:81"/>There are theſe three things to be conſidered concerning Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He had no ſins of his own to ſuffer for, but for his peoples by way of imputation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The taking the ſins of his people upon himſelf in a ſubſerviencie to the gracious deſign of Gods decree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe ſins were ſo heavy upon him, that they cauſed him to ſuffer thoſe agonies and pains which none but himſelf could endure. Now this ſpeaks <hi>ſin to be exceeding ſinful,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding odious to God, and dangerous to us; when Juſtice it ſelf could not any other ways be ſatisfied but by his ſufferings. This ſpeaks ſin to a thing hateful, abominable, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; it renders ſin odious, there is nothing but ſin that can undo us: therefore God tells his antient people, <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtreyed thy ſelf:</hi> that which others could never have done, that which I would not have done, even that thou haſt done againſt thy ſelf by thy ſins.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel propounds the only remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, it repreſents ſin odious, and it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Jeſus Chriſt every way ſufficient to deliver us from ſin. <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> The Goſpel is therefore a Meſſage of glad Tydings, becauſe it tells us how ſin may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: all the Rules of humane Invention could never reach this great truth, how ſin may may be pardoned and Juſtice ſatisfied, and how infinite wrath may be appeaſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It appears to be the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, becauſe it takes off all thoſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might keep us at a diſtance from
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46197:81"/>Chriſt, and the making uſe of thoſe Rules that the Goſpel preſeribes us for the obtaining of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. There are two great diſcouragements that lie upon all awakened ſinners. The one is the ſenſe of their own unworthineſs.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Alas! ſays the poor Soul, I that am ſuch an unworthy Creature that have carried it ſo towards God, who can I expect mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Now the Goſpel diſcovers free Grace to the full, and though we have nothing to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amends for the wrongs that we have done to Divine Juſtice, yet Chriſt hath done enough on our behalf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obect.</hi> 2. <hi>But we are poor weak impotent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Repentance and Faith is our duty, but they are beyond our ſtrength and power to perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior to give Repentance and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 5.31. he tells us how we may come to believe and repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Applicat.</hi> 1. By way of Information, if the Goſpel be the Doctrine of God, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour; Then certainly it deſerves our whole man. It is ſaid of ſome kinde of ſtudies that they deſerve our whole concernment about them; it is certain that this Doctrine doth deſerve our utmoſt diligence in ſearching into the Myſteries thereof: How do many break their ſleep, and beat their brains, and diſquiet their reſt, and emacerate their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all to purchaſe a little knowledge in the things of Nature? Oh! what paines does it become us to take in ſearching into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and in being acquainted with the Goſpel
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46197:82"/>of Chriſt. Nay, it deſerves not only our utmoſt endeavours in point of diligence in inquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it but our moſt enlarged affections in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it. This is a faithfull ſaying and worthy of all acceptation: it is worthy of all acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the heartieſt and utmoſt welcome that we are able to give it.</p>
            <p>Again, it deſerves our moſt thankful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in making ſutable returns for ſuch a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>in having a converſation as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.27. <hi>Only let your converſation be as it becomes the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of reproof to ſeveral hearers of the Goſpel. As they that do not hear as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour, as if it was not a Meſſage of ſuch glad tidings. It reproves all careleſs hearers that come and ſpend a little time in attending upon the Goſpel preacht, but never after regard the truths that are preacht to have them fixt upon their hearts, and to bring forth fruits in their lives.</p>
            <p>It reproves all nice hearers, that are dainty and curious, that cannot be ſatisfied with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, unleſs it be neatly dreſt up to them.</p>
            <p>It reproves all Critical hearers that come to hear the Goſpel and not to be judged by it, but to judge of the Miniſters parts and gifts.</p>
            <p>It reproves all ſlothful hearers that come and give attendance on the Goſpel, but carry away little impreſſion by it upon their Souls, and that do not make it their buſineſs ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In a word, it reproves all hypocritical hearers and this takes in all thoſe that come and give the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46197:82"/>Goſpel a hearing, but that is all they do. We are to hear to live: <hi>And your Souls ſhall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! labour to be ſetled in this great Truth, That the Goſpel is the Doctrine of God and of God our Saviour. The Goſpel hath every thing in it that may Command awe and reverence from us on the one hand, and love and obedience on the other. It is the Doctrine of God, and therefore it requires awe and reverence, and it is the Doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and therefore requires our love and chearful acceptance. Oh! was this truth but throughly believed, what ſtrange wonders might the Goſpel do in the Converſations of men. How would it Conquer all prejudice againſt it? How would it deſtroy all thoſe falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations that men build their hopes upon, and make way for Chriſt to take hold of their hearts, therefore labour to be fixt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this great Truth, that <hi>the Goſpel is the Word of, &amp; God the Doctrine of God our Savior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctr. 4. <hi>That this Doctrine of God our Saviour is a Priviledge ſo ominent, that it both deſerves and requires the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of them that live under it, to adorn it according to the capacity wherein they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three things are to be ſpoken to in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Doctrine.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That it is a priviledge very eminent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and be acquainted with this Doctrine of God our Saviour.</item>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. It is an eminent priviledge becauſe of the grand matters this Goſpel inſtructs us it: it is called the Doctrine of Salvation; and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Godlineſs; it is a Doctrine that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us <hi>how we may be good, and how we may do good, and how we may enjoy for ever all that we call good.</hi> Now theſe three things are of a vaſt comprehenſion, and in all theſe it is infinitely tranſcending all the inſtructions of the moſt wiſe Moraliſts, and the capacity of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane accompliſhments. However the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers in their time, and others in after tlmes have by their endeavours gained renown to their names by this attempt, yet how ſhort have their Aphoriſmes come of the Goſpel, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are there in their Rules, in compariſon of this Doctrine of God our Saviour. Though in ſome things they have hit the right, yet that light that was in them is as far different from the light of the Doctrine of God our Saviour as the light of a ruſh Candle differs from the Sun at noon day. Now what ever was ſpoken of any of thoſe matters contained in the Goſpel by them obſcurely, this Doctrine of God our Saviour ſpeaks our fully and clearly. I ſhall ſhew in eight or nine inſtances thereof, thoſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46197:84"/>great Principles wherein the deſign of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour is to eſtabliſh poor Creatures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every mans trueſt ſelf is his Soul. This is a principle often inculcated in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; moſt men take their luſts for themſelves, and therefore our Saviour when he would ſhew the neceſſity of ſelf-denial he calls to the pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of right eyes, and to the cutting off our our right hands. Theſe are our very ſelves, the limbs and members of us; Our luſts are as the whole body of corruption is compared in the Scripture to the whole man; for it is called the old man: as a man conſiſts of ſeveral members, ſo by reaſon of the corruption of our Nature every luſt is called our Member, every part of man being corrupted, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Put off the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts.</hi> So the work of Mortification is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Members, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. it branches forth this old man in its ſeveral members, as <hi>fornication, uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs, Idolatry,</hi> and the like. Sinners are apt to account their luſts themſelves; their pride, and ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if they be toucht in any of theſe ſins, it is as a dagger to their very hearts.</p>
            <p>Again, others account their natural ſelves themſelves; though not their corrupt members, thus did that rich perſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19 he ſpeaks to his Soul, <hi>ſaying, Soul, thou haſt goods laid up for many years,</hi> &amp;c. he thought theſe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food for his Soul, <hi>for himſelf.</hi> That which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man makes his chief Idol, or that which is the reigning luſt in any particular perſon, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46197:84"/>ſin is predominate in any perſon, that he is apt to account himſelf, and is very tender and nice of, and is not willing that it ſhould be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or hurt. But it is the common Language of the Scripture to ſpeak of the Soul, as the man, as if it ws the perſon. The Soul being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of man, it is ſrequently put for the whole man: <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.21. <hi>The King of Sodom ſaid give me the Perſons;</hi> and when <hi>Abraham</hi>

This is one great Truth, and this one priciple, which (if it were firmly believed and faithfully improved) would carry us very far in adorning the Doctrine of God our Saviour. Did men believe that their Souls are indeed themſelves, then there would not be ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ado about the body in pampering it; this body is but the beaſt in man (as a French Writer ſpeaks) it is poor fleſh that muſt ere long be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46197:85"/>Worms meat; therefore what account can be given of that nicenſs and delicateneſs of them whom all the art in the world cannot long prop up, but it will be meat for Worms. Again, why are we ſo much taken with ſenſual pleaſures, theſe are the pleaſures of them that are not themſelves: as it is ſaid of the Prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. <hi>when he came to himſelf;</hi> he was not himſelf when he was taken with husks and ſwines-meat, when thoſe things were pleaſing to him. But certainly, if our Souls be our ſelves, then moſt men are not themſelves that take care about their bodies, and minde thoſe things that are ſutable to that part of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Again, why have men ſo many diſtracting cares for the getting and preſerving, and fears of loſing thoſe things that concern this outward man, it is becauſe this truth is not firmly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Oh! what a preventer would this be of all thoſe ſorrows for outward afflictions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments in Creature comforts, and thoſe loſſes that we meet with in worldly enjoymeats. Was this Principle firmly believed, that our Souls are indeed our ſelves, there would not be ſuch an indifferencie in us about our Souls. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe two things, how great a difference the belief of this Doctrine of God would make, as to the things of our Souls: then we ſhould give all diligence, it would command our highet &amp; utmoſt diligence about them: this I might ſhew from many Scriptures, <hi>Give all diligence to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46197:85"/>maineth that they have wives be as though they had none, and they that weep as though they wept not, and they that rejoyce as though they rejoyced not:</hi> it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands moderation in our uſe of theſe outward comforts, and only earneſtneſs in theſe Soul concerns. God makes a very great difference in theſe things in his Commands, but what a ſmall difference do all men make in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices: how much more intent and ſerious are men in the things that concern their meaner part, than in thoſe things that concern their Souls, which is, themſelves. Did men but take that 100 part of the pains for their Souls that they do for their bodies, it would be better with them than it is. We are commanded <hi>firſt to ſeek the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſs:</hi> to ſeek firſt Soul mercies: I might mention many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſerences that would flow from this one Principle which would carry us very far in the practice of holineſs. How ſad a bargain do they make that do hazard their Souls for very trifles. If a man ſhould gain the whole World with the loſs his Soul, what a ſad gain would that be; nay, it would be a loſs to him, and that to purpoſe. But for how ſmall a pittance of the World do men loſe their Souls? this ſhews that they do not Judge their Souls themſelves. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this juſtifies the Children of Wiſdomn, who can rather ſuffer than ſin, who can part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but with God; who can undergoe any kind of loſſes, rather than the loſs of ſpiritual bleſſings, and forfeit them. Oh! what admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patience and courage hath appeared in the faithful Servants of God in all ages, who have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46197:86"/>ſet their ſeal to this Truth with their lives and all that hath been dear to them.</p>
            <p>Again, it ſhews that men live in a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Principle, that if it go well with our Souls, it cannot go amiſs with us: If our Souls have but the light of God's countenance lifted up upon them, if they do but thrive in Grace, and be filled with Grace, what matter though our bodies be exerciſed with pains and aches and afflictions of all kind.</p>
            <p>Again, it is a ſafe Rule to judge of all things by, according to the reference that they have to our Souls; to account thoſe things eminent and acceptable, and profitable to us that tend to the good of our Souls: As Ordinances and ſpiritual Opportunities, and liberty of acceſs to God in the duties of his worſhip and ſervice; theſe are to be eſteemed choice mercies becauſe theſe are the appointments of God for our Souls good; and for outward afflictions, when God by theſe does us good as to our Souls, we have cauſe to rank them amongſt our mercies, and to bleſs God for them, as <hi>David</hi> did, who ſaid. <hi>It was good for me that I have been afflicted,</hi> Pſ. 119.71. <hi>and in faithfulneſs haſt thou afflicted me: And bleſſed is the man whom correcteſt and teacheſt out of thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, this one Principle that our Souls and our ſelves ſpeaks the greateſt cruelty in the world to be regardleſs of them; you will pity diſtracted perſous that cut, and gaſh, and wound their bodies, becauſe they know not what they do. May you not pity obſtinate ſinners upon a higher account? Thoſe men that murder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46197:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>and deſtroy themſlves. Our Law accounts them Monſters, and it makes it appear that they are ſo by running a ſtake through their bodies when dead. But all the cruely to the body is nothing to that of the Soul. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore this one Principle, that this Doctrine of God our Saviour would have us fix in our minds, that our Souls are truly our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Principle that this Doctrine of God our Savior teacheth us is this, That the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Soul cannot conſiſt in any thing but in the enjoyment of God. This is one of thoſe Riddles that carnal men cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. <hi>They that truſt in their wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the mulititude of their riches, none of them can by any mean redeem his brother, nor give to God a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for him:</hi> They are but poor helps, theſe things will ſtand us but in little ſtead. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for all men to deſire happineſs, but becauſe our knowledge is weak, therefore thoſe deſires are confuſed and roving, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſay, who will ſhew us any good:</hi> this is the Language of many men; but becauſe of the darkneſs of mans underſtanding, therefore ſome think that good conſiſts in this, and ſome in that; but <hi>David</hi> whoſe underſtanding was enlightned and ſanctified, quickly determines the point, <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenanc upon us.</hi> Some ſeek after good, but they fix it in Corn and Wine, and the bleſſings of this life; but ſays <hi>David, Let me have but th light of thy countenance, &amp; thou wilt put more joy &amp; gladneſs into my Soul, than in the time when their corn and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46197:87"/>wine encreaſeth.</hi> So Pſa. 73.25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon the Earth that I deſire beſides thee;</hi> and it is no leſs than three times repeated in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. <hi>Cauſe thy face toſhine upon us, and we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ver, 3.7.19. All the ſtrength of Nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon giſts cannot bring the Soul to the fountain of all good; and ſo the ſubſtance of all good, it is only the Doctrine of God our Saviour that can do this. The great deſign of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to lay man and all Creaturess low, and only to advance God and Jeſus Chriſt; and thoſe upon whom this Doctrine doth powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail; it conquers all perverſe reaſonings and unbelieving thoughts in them, in ſo much that their Souls are brought to ſay with <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.6.7. <hi>The lines are fallen to me in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant places.</hi> How fully was this holy man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in this, not but that there are other things deſirable in their places, for this Doctrine doth not teach us to be ſtocks and ſtones, but it doth not permit us to ſit down with other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor to take up our reſt in them; nor doth it permit us to be caſt down when we are ſtript of other enjoyments, but it turns the bent and byas of the Soul, as I may ſo ſpeak towards God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My Soul followeth hard after God;</hi> and it knows how to make up all its loſſes in God, though all be gone; though thou art ſuch a poor perſon as that thou canſt not call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing thine own, yet if thou canſt call God thine own, thou canſt make up all in him, as <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. when all was gone, yet <hi>he encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> This is the ſecond Principle, that true happiueſs is no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46197:87"/>where to be had but in God, it cannot be had in Creatures, no not in the confluence of Creature comforts. As <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks concerning all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>The heigth ſaith it is not in me, the depth ſaith it is not in me;</hi> ſo we may ſay of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyments; though there is ſomething of this nature that doth ſhew the vanity of all things here upon the earth, yet this truth is more clearly manifeſted and ſtrongly inculcated by this Doctrine of God, than by any thing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I ſall ſhew ſome things wherein Nature may be ſatisfied from the common Principles of Reaſon, that the happineſs of the Soul cannot conſiſt in any thing but in the enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Principle from Nature is this, Nothing can make us happy which a man may be without, and yet be happy: this excludes all things almoſt in the world, a man may be happy without riches, &amp; therefore riches cannot make him happy; a man may be happy without great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the World, without the eſteem of men, without worldly proſperity, without a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things whcih have nothing elſe to advance them in our eſteem, but onely our own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Theſe are not bread, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.2. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread;</hi> theſe things below cannot profit nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the time of greateſt need.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nothing that a man may be cloyed and glutted with, can make him happy; nothing that is diſquieting or troubleſome to the Soul can be its happineſs; there is nothing of all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, but there may be a ſurfetting with them; and a ſuperfluity of theſe things may be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46197:88"/>as burdenſome as to want a ſufficiencie for our ſupport: a may as well have too much of outward things, as too little for his comfort. The Prayer of wiſe <hi>Agar</hi> was good, he prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt too much as well as too little, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. there may be as much as may diſtracrt our thoughts with cares, and to make us ſlaves and drudges to them, and to deprive us of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of what we have. It was <hi>Auguſtus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in his high concition, being the ſecond Roman Emperor, <hi>That he could never be at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for himſelf, becauſe of his buſineſſes;</hi> and ſo I may ſpeak of knowledge: Knowledge of all things is moſt pleaſant and rational to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ranks this among the pieces of vanity, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 1.18. <hi>In much wiſdom there is much grief, and he that increaſeth knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth ſorrow:</hi> So for pleaſures and all kinds of wordly enjoyments whatſoever, they cannot be pleaſant to us ſhould they be perpetuated, but we ſhould need ſome intermiſſion to ſweeten them to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which cannot ſatisfie all the deſires of man cannot make him happy, and therefore nothing below God can make him happy: Man is a neceſſitous Creature, and nothing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low can ſupply his neceſſities; it muſt be a good adequate to all our neceſſities that can do it, and this only can be God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nothing that is unſutable to the Soul can be the happineſs of it. Now the Soul is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riual being, therefore nothing but ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, enjoyments, and refreſhments are ſutable to the Soul: for men to place their comforts in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46197:88"/>outward things, is to forget themſelves to have Souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nothing that is diſproportionable to the Soul in point of duration can be the happineſs of the Soul. The Soul is immortal, and nothing that is mortal can be its happineſs: <hi>Deliver me from the men of this world;</hi> wicked men are ſtiled the men of this world, they have <hi>their good things here,</hi> and they have all they are like to have; and therefore <hi>David</hi> made it his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to God, that he might be delivered from from them; that is, as to their condition. <hi>O Lord deliver me from the men of this world, who have their portion in this life.</hi> Now though theſe Principles be agreeable to Nature, and many of the Heathen have gone very far in owning and acknowledging of them, yet this Doctrine of God our Saviour is tranſcendent in theſe very truths themſelves, becauſe it doth improve, heighten, and advance theſe natural Principles, it makes them both more clear, and powerful, and convincing; it helps the Soul to a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſation of theſe things, and perceive that there is nothing that can reliſh with it, or content it, or quiet it beſides God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It directs us how we that are afar of from God may be brought nigh to God: how we that are enemies by Nature (not only by evil works) evil hearts, by evil frames and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may become friends. God and we are at a diſtance; <hi>Can two walk together and not be a greed?</hi> Now this Doctrine of God our Saviour thews us how all the difference between God and us may be taken up <hi>(by Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> this is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46197:89"/>the great deſign of the Doctrine of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal this to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>His Name ſhall be called Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins.</hi> This is the Salvation, for in ſaving from ſin, he ſaves from all preſent and future miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>How does Chriſt ſave from ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Juſtifying our Perſons by his Blood in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying for all the guilt we have contracted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And by ſanctifying our Natures by his Spirit, in ſubduing thoſe perverſe and crooked diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the hearts of all by nature.</p>
            <p>Again, it points out how we may come to have an intereſt in Chriſt, and how Chriſt is willing to be ours if we are but willing to be his: He is willing to be our Saviour, if we are but willing to be his Subjects, and to accept of his Government.</p>
            <p>It directs us where to go for ſtrength to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a full reſignation of our ſelves to him, that we may go to the promiſes of God, and to the ſpirit of God and fetch ſtrength from them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the full enjoyment of God is not in this world. The happineſs of Gods people here is but in its infant ſtate: the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Whilſt we are preſent in the body, we are abſent from the Lord:</hi> they that enjoy moſt of Gods preſence here, have but a kinde of abſence, if compared with the preſence that they ſhall have of God hereafter, 2 <hi>Corinth. ver.</hi> 5.6, 7. <hi>We walk by faith and not by ſight</hi> that is we have not the fruition of God in that fulneſs, but by faith we expect it; we have not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46197:89"/>our happineſs in hand, but we have it in hope: the knowledge that we have of God now is but in part, our graces are imperfect here, we ſee God now darkly, <hi>as in a glaſs,</hi> in the glaſs of his Creatures, in the glaſs of his Ordinances, in the gleſs of his Experiences; but then we ſhall ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap>eartning as the People of God are ſubject unto: This Doctrine tells us, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is here only inchoative, but hereafter it will be Conſummated; and that this future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is as ſure (as if it was now enjoyed) to all who are truly called; &amp; to aſcertain this, God hath given his people many foretaſts of their bleſſed eſtate hereafter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>He hath given to us the earneſt of his ſpirit: viz.</hi> The Graces and Comforts of his Spirit, thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings and revivings which only the Spirit of God can work in the hearts of his people; theſe are enough to ſupport and ſecure them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the great work and buſineſs of Man here upon the Earth is to glorifie God: All things as they are of God, and by God, ſo they are to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>laſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Every man hath his work ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46197:90"/>here upon the Earth, and this life is the time wherein this work is to be finiſhed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>Father, I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> The work he had to do was to glorifie God: thus the ſame work is given proportionably to all Believers; <hi>Our work is to purge our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> This is the deſign both of the Threatnings and Promiſes: all the parts of this Doctrine of God our Saviour is to engage us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſerious undertaking of purging out of all filthineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. That it is the deſign of the threatnings is clear to all; and that it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Promiſes (ſaith the Apoſtle) Where fore having ſo many gratious Promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit. All the kindneſs that that the Promiſes diſcover and hold out to us allow of no Latitude to ſin and wickedneſs: no, they are the ſtrongeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to Sanctity and Holinerſs that can be. <hi>[Having theſs Promiſes]</hi> what Promiſes are thoſe? <hi>I will be their God and they ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? ple,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. that one Promiſe is the ſum and ſubſtance of all. So our work here upon the Earth is to mind eſpecially the work of our Souls: this is a great and choice thing that God hath inſtructed us in. And alſo to promote the Spiritual good (eſpecially) of otheres; not only to be bleſſed our ſelves, but to be bleſſings to others: that Gods Word may run and be glorified, not only amongſt our ſelves but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others. In one word, our work here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46197:90"/>the Earth is to devote our whole ſelves, our all to Gods ſervice; to give all we have to him, that holineſs to the Lord may be written upon our hearts, and acted in our lives.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That it is impoſſible that we ſhould ever live to ſo mucxh puroſe, ſo much to the true Comfort, and real Happineſs, as by living unto God, and in Communion with him. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Doctrine of God our Saviour, is to fix this Principle in our hearts: <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon them, and upon the whole Iſrael of God.</hi> This is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, that they do walk according to this Doctine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Though there be many diſcouraging weakneſſes and infirmities in the beſt of Saints, yet we are to hearken to what relief this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine propounds againſt both: it is the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many a poor Soul (of every awakended Soul) that is gratious, it dare ſcarcely pray, or hear, or engage in any duty, becauſe it finds ſo great unfitneſs and unſuitableneſs for duty: But this Doctrine directs us how we may be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and how of weak we may be made ſtrong, it dirextrs us to go to the Spirit for its aſſiſtance, and to Jeſus Chriſt for acceptance.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That all the Afflictions and Oppoſitions we can meet with in this world upon th account of our cleaving to God, are not ſo confiderable as to render the ways of God unlovely. St <hi>Paul</hi> had caſt up the account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. he tells us the reſult of his thoughts after he had Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he had weighed and Conſidered what it

Now to know that glory in Heaven which the Saints ſhall enjoy; how will that recompence all the afflictions, troubles, and perſeeutions that may befall the people of God upon the account of teir cleaving to God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That there is an abſolute neceſſity of living the life of Faith in all Conditions: In Proſperity not to be lifted up, but by faith to live upon God whilſt we have other things to keep our hearts looſe from them; ſo in adverſity when we are ſtript of theſe things, ſtill to keep our hearts in an equal poyſe and frame: this is the life of Faith, theſe are the great Principles wherein this Doctrine of God our Saviour deſigns to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. It muſt needs be an eminent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to enjoy the Doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe of the many attempts of Sathan, and his inſtruments to rob the Church of God of ſo great a benefit: if it was not ſo great, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than would not be ſo buſie to imploy his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt it: Sathan would be content that men ſhould be great, and grow rich, ſo that their hearts do but go out after theſe things; but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46197:91"/>he cannot that they ſhould enjoy the free uſe of the Goſpel. The Apoſtate Andgels ſince they left their firſt ſtation, have uſed all devices to make Man as miſerable as themſelves; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compare <hi>Job</hi> 1.7. with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. in <hi>Job</hi> 1.7. God asked Sathan, <hi>Wence comeſt thou? Then Sathan anſwered the Lord, and ſaid, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</hi> (this ſpeaks his diligence) and you find 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>He goes up and down like a Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> (this ſpeaks his deſign which he goes up and down in the earth for) he is a kind of an ubiquitary and continuall Spye, obſerving what mens deſigns and diſpoſitions are, that he may accordingly ſute his Methods and Devices, and he goes up and down as a Roaring Lyon. Now becauſe Sathan well knows, and by experience finds that nothing hath more conduced to the reeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Souls out of his powere, and more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the increaſe of his Kingdom, nay nothing doth more endager his final over throw than this Doctrine of God our Saviour, therefore he is come down with much wrath againſt it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9, 12. <hi>And the great Dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent called the Devil and Sathan which deceiveth the whole world, he was caſt out into the earth, and his Angels were caſt out with him:</hi> and in <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>The Devil is come down to you having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> It was ſopken of thoſe times immediatly ſucceeding the Miniſtry of that great Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> by whom this book was written Now this caſting down of Sathan, and the caſting out
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46197:92"/>of his Inſtruments (his Angels) is by the Doctrine of the Goſpel: thus our Saviour ſent out his Seventy Diſciples to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17, 18. when they returned home again, they came with joy, ſaying <hi>Lord, even the Devils are ſubſect to us through they Name.</hi> ver. 18, <hi>And he ſaid unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven.</hi> The deluſions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran can no more ſtand before the light of the Goſpel, than <hi>Dagon</hi> could ſtand before the Ark: How do the miſts and ſhades of the night va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at the appearance of this Sun? It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that Satan beſtirs himſelf to his untmoſt to hinder the preaching of the Goſpel which he knows will be the pulling down of his own Kingdom. There are three wayes or courſes that Satan hath uſeually taken to hinder the ſpreading, and endeavoured the extirpation of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By engaging the Princes and Potentates, and great Ones of the World to do their utmoſt to ſuppreſs it. This is that which was foretold by the Prophet <hi>David</hi> long ſince, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>The Heathen rage, and the People imagine a vain thing: the Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Annointed:</hi> But all is but a vain thing. But this ſhews the Combinations that Satan would raiſe up againſt the Church, and that amongſt the great Ones of the Earth; and this is partly by their Laws and Edicts, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the ſearching into this Holy Writ, theſe Oracles of God: See how the Jews had laid their heads together and met in Councel to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46197:92"/>this Doctrine in thoſe times; how they <hi>ſtourged and impriſoned,</hi> and uſed all kind of <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm,</hi> to prevent the <hi>ſpreading</hi> of the Goſpel, as you may read in the Book of the <hi>Acts, Acts</hi> 5.27, 28. and 4.18. <hi>They commanded them not to ſpeak at all, nor to teach in the Name of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, not only by their Edicts forbidding the preaching of the Goſpel, but farther by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing up fierce perſecution againſt the Goſpel. How great a crime is it at this day among the Papiſts to have a Bible in the Houſe? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> days loſt their lives upon this very account? it was not their perſons that they laboured to deſtroy ſo much, as their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; for upon their renouncing the Faith of the Goſpel they did eſcape: you may read how all along in thoſe times of Perſecution they might have eſcaped all thoſe dangers, if they would but have parted with this Goſpel and Doctrine of God our Saviour, they might have preſerved their lives; but as it is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. where you read of the cruelties that were exerciſed to wards the people of God, <hi>they were tortured, ſorely afflicted, not accepting deliver ance.</hi> Was not deliverance deſirable? Yes, but they could not have it upon any other terms, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as were unſafe to their Souls: and what was it to preſerve a monmentany life, and to run the hazard of the everlaſting welfare of their Souls? on thoſe terms they did not, they durſt not accept deliverance; and theſe have been the terms all along that the enemies of the Church have ſtood upon, raiſing up Seducers to corrupt this Doctrine; when he cannot hinder
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46197:93"/>this Doctrine from ſpreading, he labours to bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its ſpreading to advantage. How many Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers hath Statan raiſed up in all Ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath laboured to mingle their poyſon with this milk, how active he hath been and doth continue to be, doth appear by the many cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and warnings that St. <hi>Paul</hi> all along gives the Church againſt them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>That in henceforth be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftines, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> Obſerve, Satan im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes his Emiſſaries; they are their Craſts-maſters, they are notable Artiſts, very skilful to do miſchief. The ſleights of men and cunning craftineſs: It is a Metaphor from Dice, an An that ſome have of cogging a Dye, that ſo they many make it anſwer to what caſt they pleaſe) ſuch Crafts-maſters are theſe Seducers, they are very ſubtle and dextrous in their Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems to deceive unawares. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For we have not followed cunningly deviſed Fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Principles by the ſubtilty and Art of thoſe inſtruments of Satan which he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in all Ages of the Church: the Reaſon why truth is longer a ſpreading than error is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe truth is contrary to our corrupt Nature, but error is ſurable to them; our hearts are as tinder to receive what is bad, every ſpark kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles the fire, but they are as wet wood to receive thoſe ſparks of light that God from his Words darts into them. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> &amp; others have taken a great deal of pains in ſhewing how in all Ages downward ever ſince the times of the Apoſtles, the Devil hath been at this kinde of work, and he hath imploy'd this inſtruments herein: and we are not without experiences in our dayes of thoſe perſons that deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and that would make the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, and faith in Chriſt of no effect. This is <hi>to deny the Lord that bought them and to bring damnation upon themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a third way whereby Satan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babours to obſtruct the ſpreading of the truth, and to ſuppreſs the Doctrine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that is by exerciſing his utmoſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf by working upon mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3 4, 5. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt; in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.</hi> Obſerve, he hath a notable art in blinding the eyes of men with corrupt miſtakes, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſinuations. Chap. 11.3. <hi>I am jealous over you, lest by any means as the Serpent beguiled Eve
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46197:94"/>by his ſubtily, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Panl</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt ſetled Chriſtians; he was jealous of them, it was out of the abundance of his love to, and care for them: Now Satans great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, is, if he cannot keep us from this Doctrine, then he labours to corrupt it, and thereby to hinder the efficacie of it, and ſo to render this Doctrine of Salvation inſtrumental to promote our deſtruction: And thus thoſe many deſignes of Satan againſt this Doctrine, and his diligence to carry on thoſe deſignes, is a great Argument of the eminencie of the priviledge of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Argument.</hi> The wonderful Providence of God, and his perpetual care in preſerving this Goſpel notwithſtanding all the attempts that Hell hath made againſt it: Be ſure if any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power or policie (for what policie or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is greater than Satans) could have prevail'd againſt this Doctrine of God our Saviour, there had not been the leaſt part of this Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the world at this day. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration proves that this Doctrine of God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.39. the counſel of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> to the Jews, <hi>If it be of God it will stand, ye cannot overthrow it</hi> Now it is an Argnment that this Doctrine is of God, becauſe it hath ſtood ſo long, for above 1600 years; and it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it is the Doctrine of God, becauſe it is of ſuch great conc ernment to the Church; if it had not been an eminent and needful privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he would not have employed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnees ſo conſtantly about the prſer vation of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46197:94"/>it: We read when the Iſraelites had no farther need of Miracles, God did not then continue to work Miracles for that people; aſſoon as ever they had the parched Corn, the fruits of the Land, Manna ceaſed the ſelf-ſame day: God would not then be at the expence of a Miracle, though they came from him as eaſily as words do from men; be would not be at the expence of a Miracle but for his Peoples neceſſity. This Doctrine of God our Saviour is ſaid to be the Foundation upon which the Church is built; <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Doctrine,</hi> this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of thine, <hi>I will build my Church.</hi> Eph. 2.20. <hi>And are built upon the Foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt being the chief Corner-ſtone.</hi> Upon the Foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles; How can that be? For it is ſaid, <hi>other Foundation can no man lay than what is laid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for there is no Name given under Heaven whereby we can be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Divines here diſtinguiſh between a perſonal Foundation and a Doctrinal Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Jeſus Chriſt is the only perſonal Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the only Perſon that can be built upon, and the Doctrine of Chriſt in the Goſpel, that is the only doctrinal Foundation, and if we build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, we build aright.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you three Inſtances to ſhew how wonderfully the Providence of God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the preſervation of this Doctrine of God our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that he hath preſerved thoſe Books of Scripture wherein this Doctrine is contained
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46197:95"/>from utter ruine and extirpation: How many choice and admirable Books (wherein hath been excellent pieces of Learning) have periſhed, and been eaten out by the ruſt of time? Yet thoſe Books have had no Edicts put forth a againſt them to endanger the owning of them, nor againſt the advancing of the ſtudy of them: Nay, they have had great incouragement to promote thoſe ſtudies, and in all reſpects the greateſt care imaginable to preſerve them; but they have all periſhed, and are utterly gone: but this Goſpel hath been preſerved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the attempts and deſigns againſt it: we have no Books of Antiquity and ancient ſtanding as the Goſpel is: It is a ſmart paſſage of one ſpeaking of the improvements made in all pieces of Knowledge; (ſays he) <hi>It is but a vain kind of boaſt to ſpeak of augmenting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſince all thoſe new editions that have been made of any ſcience, are but the recoveries of what formerly hath been loſt:</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, when he ſaith, <hi>there is nothing new under the Sun.</hi> But God himſelf takes care of theſe Books, and this proves that they contain in them thoſe Truths that are neceſſary for the Churches good, for the converſion and bringing in of wandring Souls, and for the edifying and building up of thoſe that are brought in, and ſo long as there is any one Soul either unbrought in, or unbrought up, ſo long as any ſingle Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt continues in a ſtate ſhort of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Goſpel ſhall continue. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. That Apoſtles, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers <hi>ſhall be in the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46197:95"/>Church for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Christ.</hi> So long as we are ſhort of perfection, ſo long ſhall theſe helps continue. Now had not God taken care of the Goſpel all thoſe inſtructions that are contained in it had long ſince been buried in oblivion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God hath been careful to preſerve theſe Books from extirpation, ſo alſo from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; that as not any part of it hath been deſtroyed, ſo no ſalſe Principle have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed: and this is as great a wonder as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that though the powers of earth and hell have been bent againſt it, though they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted malice nor power, yet they have neither deſtroyed and extirpated it, nor brought in another Goſpel to the excluſion of it, though there were early attempts againſt it, as you find <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.7. <hi>Imarvel that you are ſo ſoon removed unto another Goſpel.</hi> This hath been one of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ways to ſet up new Doctrines quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, thereby thinking to prevail, but ſuch hath been the care of God concerning this Doctrine, that it is obſerved as a remarkable thing by Eccleſiaſtical Writers, that in every age of the Church, when Satan hath raiſed up ſome dangerous Inſtrument to corrupt this Doctrine, God hath raiſed up another eminent Inſtrument for the defence of this Goſpel; as when <hi>Arrius</hi> was ſo buſie in crying down the Divinity of Chriſt, God then raiſed up <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:46197:96"/>as an Antidote againſt that poyſonous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. And ſo when <hi>Pelagius</hi> did endeavour to pull own Free grace, and advance and raiſe up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ature, God then raiſed up St. <hi>Suſtine</hi> for the lefence of the Truth. In all Ages of the Church God hath taken care to preſerve this Doctrine from being corrupted. Now that this Doctrine that hath had ſo many enemies, and hat been ſo ſtrongly oppoſed, and thoſe enemies have been countenanced, and had all the humane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that this world could afford, yet that poor contemptible, deſpiſed, and perſecuted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments ſhould preſerve this Doctrine from corruption, and that this Doctrine ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as the three Children in the fiery furnace, having not a hair of their heads ſinged, this is the wonderful Providence of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In animating ſo many thouſands to bear witneſs to this Doctrine with their lives. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Martyrlogie tells us, to reckon up all the Saints that have ſealed to the truth of this Doctrine with their blood in the ſeveral ages of the Church would amount to no leſs than five thouſand for every day in the year. But this hath been obſerved by all, that not only men of courage, but timorous women, and not only the Learned, but illiterate; not only the Souldier, but others have been animated and aſſiſted by God, that they have rather parted with their lives, than theſe Truths: this was the great Controverſie in the <hi>Maryan</hi> Perſecution. And it is impoſſible that this Doctrine ſhould ever have paſſed through ſo much fire and blood in ſo many Ages, if an extraordinary Spirit had not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46197:96"/>ſupported them, and enabled them to bear their teſtimony. Theſe Arguments ſhew that it is a Doctrine of very great concernment to the Church and People of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Partic.</hi> 2. That the great and principal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgmeat that God expects from all that do partake of this great and eminent priviledge is, that they ſhould do their utmoſt to adorn this Doctrine of God our Saviour. To adorn it, what is that? To render it amiable, beautiful, and lovely: that this Doctrine may be more taking with them that are ſtrangers to it: as in <hi>v.</hi> 5. that the Word of God be not blaſphemed: and the chief Commendation we can do to this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is practical Conformity to it, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle adviſes, <hi>Eph</hi> 4.1. <hi>I therefore the Priſoner of the Lord beſeech you that ye walk worthy of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wherewith ye are called.</hi> That you walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Only let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be as becometh the Goſpel:</hi> that it be meet, that it be ſuch as may adorn it. And how this may be, how we may adorn the Goſpel, how we may walk worthy of the Goſpel the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Phil</hi> 1.11. <hi>being filled with the fruits of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is to adorn the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That they ſhould ſhew forth the the virtues and praiſes of him who hath called them,</hi> &amp;c. as an apt Scholar, that is much improved in Learning is a praiſe to his Maſter. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Corinthians</hi> his Commendation, ſo a gratious Chriſtian is a Commendation to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity. Theſe Rules are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and high, this is the Chriſtians Motto, we do not ſpeak great words but we live great things.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:46197:97"/>
            <p>This is the charge that our Saviour gives toall his hearers, but eſpecially to thoſe he imploys in the capacity of the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> to glorifie this Doctrine is by giving occaſion to to others to glorifie it, to have it in high eſteem; our Saviour there doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to ſeek vain glory, to ſeek applauſe and eſteem with men, to gain reputation among others, but that they may glorifie God, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi> &amp;c. This light may be underſtood of the light of the Doctrine of God, but it muſt alſo be underſtood of the light of their Converſations. Now to ſhew wherein all Chriſtians are in a capacity of adorning this Doctrine of God our Saviour. In general.</p>
            <p>By walking exactly according to the Rules of this Doctrine, as the councel of the Apoſtle is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. <hi>See then ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe.</hi> To walk cicumſpectly is to walk exactly, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Greek ſignifies. Walk exactly and this is your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not to walk exactly is the greateſt folly: <hi>not as fools, but as wiſh.</hi> And oh what a lovely thing would Chriſtianity appear to be in the eyes of them that are ſtrangers to it, was there but that exactneſs in our lives that this Doctrine by its ſeveral Rules teacheth. I ſhall ſpeak to three things in opening this,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46197:97"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As to our Carriage to towards God</item>
                  <item>2. Towards others, To our Enemies.</item>
                  <item>2. Towards others, To our Friends.</item>
                  <item>3. Towards our ſelves.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of our Carriage towards God in following God fully. This Doctrine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to ſerve God with all out might and ſtrength: this is exemplified by ſeveral paterns in Scripture. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee, thou art my right hand.</hi> And of <hi>Caleb</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. <hi>He followed God fully.</hi> We muſt not only ſerve God in ſome duties, which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of reproach in them to our names, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of prejudice to our concerns, but even in thoſe duties by the obſervance of which we run the greateſt hazard, as to all that is dear to us in this world: and to mind theſe heartily, and in good earneſt, and becauſe God Commands them, and becauſe they are his Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In ſhunning whatſoever might offend God; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>I hat every falſe way. You that love the Lord, hate evil. Pſal.</hi> 79.10. If there be any thing of love in the Soul to God, there cannot but be hatred of what ever is contrary to him: your hatred is never right unleſs it be grounded upon principles of love to God, <hi>You therefore hate evil becauſe ye love God: How can I do this wickedneſs ond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> complyance with his Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes temptation, he involved himſelf in; but this Doctrine taught him not to allow himſelf
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46197:98"/>in any thing that was offenſive to God. And ſo ſhould we ſtand upon our watch and guard as thoſe that are ſenſible of the corruptions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the activeneſs of Sathan to make uſe of thoſe Corruptions to deceive us, and to draw us rrom God: and this Rule hath been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the people of God all along. <hi>Job</hi> made a Covenant with his eyes, <hi>David</hi> kept his mouth as with a bridle; both of them by theſe Metaphorical expreſſions do ſignifie their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and care to keep themſelves from being led a ſide into ſin, or any thing that might be offenſive to God. This is to adorn the Goſpel when we thus carry it towards God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Not only to ſerve God, but to delight in his Service, and to take complacencie in every duty we perform, <hi>Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord, and he will give thee the deſire of thine heart.</hi> It is a dreadful Judgment that God threatned to execute upon his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> becauſe they would <hi>not ſerve him with chearfulneſs in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things, therefore they ſhould ſerve their Exemies in hunger, and cold, and nakedneſs,</hi> in the want of all things. They changed their Maſter, and it was a ſad change too. It was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Apoſtles (in thoſe times of perſecution) when they could not profeſs this Goſpel, but it would coſt them dear, yet, (whatever their food was it had good ſawce) <hi>they eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart, rejoycing in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This duty hath been practiſed by all they have been ſincere. St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was canvaſing the caſe with his own ſoul, and diſputing with himſelf whether
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46197:98"/>all was well with him or not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. in this took comfort, <hi>as to my inward man, I delight in the Law of God.</hi> I do not only do it, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do it. To do what God commands, and to do it as our burthen, is unſuitable to this Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>I find then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> It is natural for men to delight in nothig but ſin, and to take pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs: <hi>They are lovers of pleaſure</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>more than lovers of God:</hi> and he tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt</hi> of ſome kind of Monſters among men, <hi>who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> this is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the true account of Gods ſeverity againſt them: every part of our duty is our priviledge, God hath required nothing from us as our duty, but it is as much to our preſent comfort, as our future happineſs; it is only carnal reaſon that makes objections againſt the Commands of God; it is the Language of corrupt nature, <hi>When will the Sabbath be over?</hi> Amos 8 5. but the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a gratious heart is, When will there be a return of Sabbath opportunities, and of means for us to enjoy Communion with God? Natural men cannot be ſo ſick of ſpiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as gratious ſouls are ſick of worldly diverſions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>He hath nto given us the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption whereby we cry abba Father.</hi> When we are able to look up to God as a Father, we cannot long endure his abſence. <hi>Abſolom</hi> was ſorely afflicted for his two years abſence from <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:46197:99"/>at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that he might. ſee his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But what ever langauge corrupt niture may ſpeak, the great deſign of this Doctrine of God our Saviour (wherever it works effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) where ever it comes in power) is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our affections and to purge out this droſs, and toturn the whole bent of our hearts towards God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>My Soul longeth for thee:</hi> and what we long for (while that is abſent) makes us take no pleaſure in what we enjoy; <hi>A day in in thy preſence is better than a thouſand elſe where. Pſal.</hi> 84.10. <hi>I had rather</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi>) <hi>be a door-kecper in the Houſe of God, than dwell in the Tents of wickedneſs, in the meanest rank of Ser. vants.</hi> And ſaid the Prodigal, though I be but as a hired Servant, yet if am but one of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily I am well enough, it is more than I deſerve. <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God:</hi> he ſpeaks of it as on experienced truth, and that he ſought for, and took pleaſure in; <hi>One thing have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Lord, and that will I ſeek after,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4.</p>
            <p>Now not only to engage in the duties of of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to account them our delight, our chiefeſt refreſhment, and to be of nothing ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient as the want of thoſe Opportunities, is that which this Doctrine of God our Saviour teacheth us, <hi>viz.</hi> to delight our ſelves in God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To devolve all our care upon God; <hi>Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your cares upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> Though yo many meet with loſſes and troubles that may come upon you as thick as <hi>Jobs</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles came upon him, even as the Waves of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46197:99"/>Sea, one upon the neck of the other, yet to be quiet and calm.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Doctrine teacheth us to devote our whole ſelves to him without any reſervation, and this commanded, and practiſed: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy might, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy Soul.</hi> And we find this in the practice of Gods people, as to their endeavours: <hi>Praiſe the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me, Praiſe his holy Name, Pſal.</hi> 103.1. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee, Pſal.</hi> 119.10. This Doctrine directs all to give up their whole ſelves to God, and thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> &amp;c. all was nothing in compariſon of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To be ſatisfied with, and thankful for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Conſciences, though we be guilty of many failings, and whatever we meet with in Gods ſervice: though we have never ſo great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, yet if we can but approve our hearts to he ſincere to God; this was the comfort of all the holy men of God. Though <hi>David</hi> deſigned this, and deſired to be inſtrumental in building the Lord a houſe, though he had not that honor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, yet he rejoyced in this, <hi>that God had put it into his heart,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.10, 11. <hi>Then the people rejoyced for that they offered willingly. David the King rejoyced with great joy, wherefore David bleſſed the Lord before all the Congregation:</hi> he accounted it an honor to be imployed in the work; but that he made it ſincerely his aim was his comfort. So Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> though he found many infirmities in himſelf, yet becauſe he was ſincere, God did afford him eminent aſſiſtance,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46197:100"/>
               <hi>I will glory in my infirmities,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. becauſe when <hi>I am weak</hi> in my ſelf, <hi>then am I ſtrong</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus. So he ſpeaks of it as the common ſupport of all believers, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſincerity: 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of Conſciences, that in ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity we have had our converſations in the world;</hi> though we have not been without our failings nor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, yet this is that which comforts us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both, that God hath honoured us to be ſincere; though we have met with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet we have our rejoycings in the midſt of our ſorrows, and this is our comfort.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To moderate our affections to all things here below, ſo far as they are diverſions from our converſe with God. This Doctrine teacheth us the greateſt magnanimity, the higheſt courag, the trueſt generoſity, and nobleneſs of ſpirit that can poſſibly be found; that is a true great ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which can contemn all the great things of this world. You read <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he had the opportunity of being <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Succeſſor in <hi>Egypt, yet he refuſed to be called the Son of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs daughter,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> This Doctrine acquaints us with ſuch comforts, with ſuch priviledges, with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments as render all the moſt tempting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the world inconſiderable.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To carry it towards God with quietneſs and ſubmiſſion to his Providences. God loves a chearful giver, and doer, and ſufferer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>and not only ſo, but we glory in tribulation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:46197:100"/>this is a high pitch: <hi>they ſuffered joyfully the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yling of their goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. This is a point, to loſe all, and yet to be chearful, and yet to rejoyce: Now what ever troubles we may meet with, this Doctrine pacifies and quiets us, and makes us chearful in the midſt of thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; it tells us that no troubles befall us but what come from God. <hi>Afflictions ariſe not out of the ground, nor troubles out of the duſt, but God lifts up and caſts down.</hi> It teacheth us that God is wiſe, and knows what is beſt for us, and that it is much better for us to be in his carving than our own; and that that cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs that is of Gods doing, who is both wiſe, and able, and faithful, and in all theſe <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi> I remember a paſſage of one, who when he was threatned to be perſecuted, impriſoned, tormented, replied, <hi>O bleſſed be God you have not the power of Heaven nor Hell, you cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to bring me into the one, or to throw me into the other, theſe are beyond your power; but God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be truſted in, and relied upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To approve our ſelves to God in ſparing no coſts nor pains in his ſervice. <hi>David</hi> did diſdain to ſerve God with that which coſt him nothing; ſo ſhould we though the ſervice of God be coſtly to us upon other accounts, to pray, and to hear, and to meditate, though it ſhould coſt us the ſweat of our Souls, though it ſhould coſt us pains and labour, ſo we do but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge theſe duties aright, vet we ſhould think all well imployed, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1 8.14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver, who having a malé in his flock offers. to God a female, or a corrupt thing:</hi> do you preſent
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46197:101"/>that to God that you dare not preſent to you earthly Magiſtrate, curſed be that deceiver. <hi>I am a great God (ſaith the Lord) of Hosts, and my Name is dreadful among the Heathen, and I will make it dreadful among you, if you carry it thus towards me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>P.</hi> To injoyn a confinement of our zeal, activity and earneſtneſs unto the ſervice of God; it is good to be zealous, but in what? in this, in the ſervice of God, and the concerns of his Name; it is good to be zealous in a good matter; zeal is an excellent affection, it is the heighth of our affection, but it muſt be well fixt, otherwiſe it is dangerous: you find how reſolute the people of God have been of old and how zealous in the ſervice of God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>But as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord:</hi> Do you take your courſe, chooſe whom you will ſerve, whether the Idols of the Nations wherein you live, or whether you will ſerve the true God, but as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord. <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaks firſt for himſelf, and then for his family; he uſes this kinde of provocation as a prudential and preſſing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that would prevail with the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their Idols, and to ſubmit themſelves cordially and heartily to the ſervice of God: there is a moderation indeed that is allowable, yea, neceſſary, which is a duty; but moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the things of God, and an indifferencie therein, is a deteſtable luke-warmneſs; <hi>becauſe thou art neither hot nor cold, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth:</hi> the ſervice of God we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to perform with our might and ſtrength to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46197:101"/>the utmoſt. <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in Spirit ſerving the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, This Doctrine teacheth us in all theſe reſpects together to honour God, and thereby to adorn his Goſpel, in following its Rules fully and univerſally in keeping cloſe to his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all our courſes. The Religion this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine teacheth admits of no mixtures: <hi>It is pure Religion and undefiled,</hi> Jam. 1.27. we muſt not vary from his inſtitutions in any thing we perform to him in the duties of his worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Object; we muſt not joyn any thing with God <hi>as the Object of morſhip;</hi> this hath been the miſcarriage of the greateſt part of the world in former Ages; we muſt not joyn Idols with God; this was the ſin of the Jews, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. <hi>Elijah adjured the people, ſaying, if God be God, ſerve him; if Baal be God ſerve him: why halt you between God and Baal:</hi> If theſe be the Inſtitutions of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, if not follow others that are ſo.</p>
            <p>Again, we muſt not joyn Saints nor Angels with God in his worſhip: this is the great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the Papiſts; it was foretold by the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 18. we muſt not joyn any thing with God as the Object of our love, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters</hi> (be ſure not two Maſters whoſe Commands are ſo contrary each to other) <hi>for he will love the one and hate the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we muſt not joyn our luſts with God, that is the worſt of all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi> Matth. 29.30. <hi>If thy right
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46197:102"/>eye offend thee, pluck it out and cact or from thee; and if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee.</hi> Nothing leſs than the intireneſs of our whole man is due to God. So in the Rules of Gods worſhip there muſt be no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>We muſt not joyn humane Traditions with Divine Inſtitutions: this was the great miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Scribes and Phariſees in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and of other Jews who followed that Doctrine. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the Traditions of men,</hi> Matth. 15.19.</p>
            <p>Again, we muſt not mingle our own fancies with Gods Inſtitutions: this was the ſin of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Lev. 10.1, 2. <hi>they offered ſtrange fire:</hi> it was fire which was neither commanded nor forbidden, but becauſe it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, therefore they drew the ſeverity of God upon them, <hi>fire came down from Heaven and deſtroyed them</hi> If you have not a Command from God for what you do in his worſhip, you can expect then no other anſwer from God: but that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands.</hi> Though you take never ſo much pains in ſerving God, if it be not the way of Gods appointment you can expect no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it.</p>
            <p>Again, We muſt not joyn the modes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the times and places in which we live, with the Ordinances and Appointments of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.3, 5. this charge is given by God as his expreſs Command, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>After the doings of the Land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, ye ſhall
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46197:102"/>not do.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>But ye ſhall keep my ſtatutes, and my Judgments, which if a man do he ſhall live in them: I am the Lord.</hi> God looks upon it as a diſowning of his Sovereignty, and a refuſing to be ſubject to him. <hi>I am the Lord, none but me;</hi> not cuſtomes, not fancies, not inventions, but if you have any ſenſe of Religion upon your hearts keep cloſe to my Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There muſt be no mixture in reſpect of our aims: the ſum of all Religion is to glorifie God; to glorifie God muſt be our deſign: now we muſt not mingle in our aims other things with the Glory of God, not the applauſe of men; you may find many that pretend highly to the Glory of God, but all the ſervice that they perform to God is, that they may be ſeen of men; this was the great ſin of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.15, 16. <hi>Take heed that you do not your alms before men to be ſeen of them:</hi> all theſe they did, but it was for applauſe in the world; they loved to greet in the Market-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to wear Phylacteries broad, wherein the Law of God was written: theſe were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences, but there was a fly in the box of Oyntment.</p>
            <p>Again, We muſt not mingle our preſent ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Gods Glory. Many will engage in the ſervice of God ſo far as King <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. who ſaid, he was willing to venture ſo far to Sea and no farther than he could return ſafe to land again: many will venture for God, but no farther than they can ſecure the main. Now this Doctrine teacheth us, that the only way to ſave our lives is to loſe them; he that walks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46197:103"/>walks ſafely: it propounds higher walk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of ſafety than the world can. Can any provide ſo well for our ſafety as God will? and God hath undertaken to keep them ſafe that do their duty. You have nothing elſe to look after. If our hearts could follow God thus, with this ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt conſtancy, and reſolution, how much ſhould we adorn this Doctrine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?</p>
            <p>This is the firſt branch how it is our duty, and how it is the great expectation of God from all thoſe that enjoy the Goſpel, to adorn it in our carriage towards God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond head how we ſhould adorn this Doctrine of God our Saviour, is, by conformity to the Rules of this Doctrine in our carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others. This Doctrine is a compleat Rule, able to make a man of God perfect through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to every good work. We want no additional Rules, no other Doctrines, but only ſuch as are by way of explication of this. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our carriage towards men here I ſhall treat more particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In our carriage to all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In our carriage to Enemies, and to Friends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In our carriage to all men in general: to carry it with meekneſs, and gentleneſs, to give no offence either to the Jew, or Gentile, or to the Church of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>A meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of grace price:</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Whoſe adorning let it not be the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46197:103"/>of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart:</hi> in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price. This is the ornament which St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> commends to Women: Women indeed may have many provocations to anger, but this is the Apparel they ſhould put on, a meek and quiet Spirit. There is no ſuch Tyranny in the world, as in private Families, as in the husbands carriage towards their wives, (though this may be the occaſion of the provocation, the women being of unquiet Spirits,) but this is good in the ſight of God, to be of meek and quiet ſpirits: and ſo we ought to carry it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all men. But more particularly, We adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour when we live in an exactneſs to thoſe Rules that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our carriage towards men, which I ſhall reduce to theſe five or ſix.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Doctrine of God our Saviour though it teacheth us to bear the greateſt of wrongs, yet it doth not allow us to do the leaſt wrong, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 15.16. <hi>That ye may be the children of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke.</hi> But how ſhall we approve our ſelves ſo? that <hi>you may be blameleſs and harmleſs. Luke</hi> 3.10. We read of thoſe hearers that came to <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> to enquire what they ſhould do, when they were wrought upon by his Miniſtry, and ſtartled, and awakened, and brought to ſee their need of Chriſt; who received this anſwer, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, <hi>And he anſwered and ſaid unto them, He that hath two Coats, let him impart to him that hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and he that hath Meat let him do likewiſe.</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:46197:104"/>ver. 13. <hi>To the Publicans, Exact no more that what is appointed you.</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>And to the Souldiers, Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your wages.</hi> This Rule extends to all the ſeveral kinds of doing wrong; there are theſe three ſeveral ways by which we are lyable to injure others.</p>
            <p>In their Names, by Defamation.</p>
            <p>In their Eſtates, by Fraude.</p>
            <p>In their Perſons, by acts of Violence.</p>
            <p>All theſe the Doctrine of the Goſpel forbith under the higheſt Penalties imaginable.</p>
            <p>In their Names; And that we are ſubject to, either by ſpreading of evil reports, or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil reports ſlightly. This we ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of, to be tender of the good names of others, the great Rule the light of Nature teacheth, To do to others as we would be willing they ſhould do to us. You would not be willing to have your Names blaſted, your Reputation defamed by others; then have the ſame care of them: but the Goſpel advanceth its principles much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>Again, We may not injure others in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, by defrauding them; <hi>Let no man go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or defraud his Brother in any matter, for the Lord is the avenger of ſuch.</hi> In our worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and earthly dealings with men this is a frequent Corruption, and it is to be wiſhed that men would more diligently hearken to thoſe Rules that this Doctrine preſcribes.</p>
            <p>And for the Perſons of men, this Doctrine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a ſtrong check and reſtraint to all Enormities of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46197:104"/>that kind: yea, it reacheth ſo far as our very thoughts, as our Saviour explains it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.22. That Law that forbids murder, forbids ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and we are guilty of murder in a malitious thought; and how many ſad denunciations of wrath are there againſt the perſon of him that is <hi>angry with his brother without a cauſe:</hi> and ſo for uncleanneſs in <hi>ver.</hi> 27. it forbids not only the outward act, but the inward thought: in all thoſe reſpects this Doctrine is a bar to injuries; we muſt neither wrong others in their names, in their eſtates, in their perſon, nor in their Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Doctrine doth not only reſtrain us from doing wrong to others, but it injoyns us to do all the good we are capable of doing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that in theſe two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In all expreſſions of kindneſs to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In all expreſſions of kindneſs to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In all expreſſions of kindneſs to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; there is ſomething due of mercy to bruit beaſts: <hi>If thy enemies Oxe or Aſs go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it him back again,</hi> Exod. 23.4. much more to the perſon of thy Neighbour. This Doctrine doth teach us to be the beſt natured perſons in all the world, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to dare to injure any in any of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, but to do all the good we can for, and to them; and it is a reproach to this Doctrine, when thoſe that profeſs it, do walk ſo unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to it.</p>
            <p>Again, it teacheth us to ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> off all wrongs
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46197:105"/>from others. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.37. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Go, and do thou likewiſe.</hi> This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, to miniſter to the neceſſities of all that are reduced to extremities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As in reſpect of the outward man, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in reſpect of the inward man, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine teacheth us to be kind to Souls: it was a high price that Chriſt ſet upon Souls; for, for their ſakes he left Heaven and died upon the Croſs; he did not come upon the earth to make his people rich, or great, to give them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wordly comforts; it was not bodily but Soul mercies he came to beſtow upon them: this is a common debt that we owe to all men as men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14. <hi>I am a debtor both to the Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and to the Gentile:</hi> to both, to do them all the good I can, but what good was this? not to teach them how to thrive in the world, to get e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates but how to be happy for ever. There are theſe two debts upon all Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to the Souls of others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a debt of inſtruction of ſuch as are ignorant: Certainly, if God takes ſo much care, as to require us to ſhew mercy to the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Oxe, or Aſs of our Neighbour: much more to the wandring ſoul of our neighbor: doth God take care of Oxen? we may apply it to this caſe, no it is written for man, it is ſpoken for man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo much ſhaken by the prevalencie of his temptation, that he had loſt all the ſenſe of the truth of Grace in his heart (ſaith our Saviour to him) <hi>when then art converted strengthen thy Brethren.</hi> It ſeemed to be a new converſion of him, he had loſt ſo much the ſenſe of his firſt Converſion: ſhew
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46197:105"/>thy thankfulneſs to God (as if he had ſaid) by ſhewing mercy to others Souls, becauſe God hath ſhewed mercy to thy Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A debt of reproof of thoſe that are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer ſin to reſt on thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but thou ſhalt in any wiſe reprove him:</hi> it is ſpoken of thoſe that partake of the ſame nature with our ſelves. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother.</hi> mercy in this kind to him is cruelty, and flattery is the moſt remote from love. <hi>James</hi> 5.20. <hi>Let him know that he which converteth a ſinner from the evil of his ways, ſhall ſave a Soul from death.</hi> O do but think what bleſſings you might be, if you would but conform to this Rule: you may ſave many a Soul from death by ſeaſonable and wiſe reproof: the meaneſt and moſt private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an owes this duty to all the world. That is the ſecond: this Doctrine teacheth us to bear wrongs, but to do none, and to do all the good we can, both to the Souls and Bodies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If through weakneſs or wickedneſs we have done wrong to others, this Doctrine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to make full reparation with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus for what wrong we have done. In the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Law proviſion was made againſt doing wrong to others, by reſtitution: which we find repeated at large <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. nor was this only a Levitical Doctrine, but Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, <hi>Zacheus</hi> crying out, <hi>Lord, if I have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any man, I will restore four-fold:</hi> there is this difference between the breach of the Commands of the firſt Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and of the Second Table. The breach of the Commands of the firſt Table ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46197:106"/>of no reſtitution, but what hath been made by Chriſt; it is impoſſible that we ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for thoſe wrongs that we have done to Divine Juſtice: But for the breach of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Second Table, beſides Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there muſt be reſtitution, becauſe then is a double wrong done; a wrong againſt God in tranſgreſſing his Commands, who commands us to carry it righteouſly, and with all integrity with thoſe with whom we have to do: now as his Commands are tranſgreſſed, ſo our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are injured; here is a double wrong (not but that the Commands of the firſt Table ſhould have a precedencie) and though Repentance may prevail for a pardon ſo far as the ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns God, and is a tranſgreſſion of his Laws yet there muſt be reſtitution alſo to teſtifie the reality of our Repentance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To rejoyce in the good of others, and that upon this account, becauſe they are perſons that partake of humane nature: it is very natural for man to envy others good, <hi>the ſpirit that dwells in us lusteth to envy,</hi> Jam. 4.5. not the good ſpirit of God, but our natural ſpirits, our corrupt ſpirits: it was the ſin of <hi>Cain,</hi> he envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the acceptance of <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice; <hi>God had reſpect to Abel and his Sacrifice, but to Cain he had not reſpect,</hi> and this filled <hi>Cain</hi> with envy, and that envy ended in murder: Nay, this is that diſtemper that is born with us, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, who ſeeing two little Infants at the breaſts of their Mother, the one lookt with a pale face upon the other, envying at what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received; he drew this Obſervation from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46197:106"/>hence, how natural this ſin of envy is, and how hardly it is caſt off, the beſt men may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with this ſin. <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a man eminent for his holineſs, every thing in him almoſt was commendable, yet we read of him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.28. <hi>One ran and told Moſes that Eldad and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad did Propheſie in the Camp; and Joſhua the ſon of Nun the ſervant of Moſes, one of his young men, anſwered and ſaid, My Lord Moſes forbid them;</hi> ſpeaking of their Propheſying. <hi>Peter</hi> envied <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, that ſingular favour he had from Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 21. <hi>And Peter ſeeing him, ſaid to Jeſus, Lord, what ſhall this man do:</hi> it is natural for us when others are on the too of the world and we at the bottom to caſt a wry look upon them; <hi>the ſpirio that dwelleth in man luſteth to envy:</hi> Now the beſt Antidote we have againſt this ill frame and temper, is the Doctrine of God our Saviour, it teacheth us to rejoyce in the good that others enjoy, though we do not enjoy the ſame our ſelves: if God give others health and we do not enjoy it our ſelves, yet rejoyce in their health, bleſſing God for others Comforts though we our ſelves are under ſtreights; and bleſſing God for others bleſſings though we do not partake of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Doctrine teacheth us to carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men humbly and tenderly in all their concerns; pride and paſſion are the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbancies of all humane Societie. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>James</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is a wiſe man and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with knowledge amongſt you? let him ſhew out of a good converſation his works with meekneſs of wiſdom; but if you have bitter envying and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46197:107"/>ſtrife in your hearts glory not, and lie not againſt truth: this wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual deviliſh. But the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, and then peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and eaſie to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits; without partiality, and without hypocriſie.</hi> This Doctrine furniſheth us with Arguments to be humble, though our condition be never ſo high: and to carry it humbly and gently, and that with all meekneſs with thoſe with whom we converſe — To be humble — 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have nothing of our own. <hi>We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we have not received. Who made thee to differ from another?</hi> To differ as to outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, in health, in abundance, what ever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is it is of Gods making. So as to a difference in reſpect of parts and gifts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this is a humbling conſideration, that we have nothing but what we have received.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have received nothing but upon the account of free-grace: we have nothing but what God gives, and we deſerve nothing but what his goodneſs inclines him to beſtow: all is the gift of God, and all that God gives; he hath no other motive to move him to beſtow, but only his own Goodneſs, there is no motive in us at all; we have deſpiſed his mercy, and rejected his kindneſs, we are unfit and unwilling to receive them, it is only free grace beſtows them; we have nothing but what God gives, and we deſerve nothing but what free Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows.</p>
            <p n="3">3 All thoſe favours that God vouchſafes to us are to humble us; whilſt he lifts us up above
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46197:107"/>others, it is to lay us low in our own thoughts in our own eſteem: the more we have received, the greater debtors we are to Divine Grace: it teacheth us that all our liftings up are of his mercy, and to keep our hearts low though we be in a high condition, in an humble frame under our great advantages, not deſpiſing our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors and not carrying it ſuperciſiouſly towards them that are our equals.</p>
            <p>In a word, this Doctrine teacheth us to carry it ſo towards all men, as becomes them that are alike ſervants to one and the ſame Maſter. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, though there are different ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here upon earth, one is ſuperior, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is inferior and ſubordinate, yet God is ſuperior to all; and therefore the Apoſtle fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently propounds this as the meaſure of our performing duties to our inferior Relations, and to our ſuperior Relations too, to do it as unto God, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.4. do it heartily, do it as to God; let us carry it humbly to all men; we are all ſervants to the ſame Maſter, let us be in what rank or condition ſoever. It is obſerved by a Learned Writer, that there is nothing makes a difference as to worldly greatneſs, but only man, ſickneſs makes no difference, the grave makes no difference, the general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes no difference, God makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, high and low are all levelled in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In our carriage towards men, this Doctrine is the greateſt Antidote againſt all unpeaceable behaviour. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> Peaee ſo
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46197:108"/>far as it is conſiſtent with holineſs. <hi>The wiſdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> not but that there may be a neceſſary vindication and defence of mens rights and proprieties; the Scripture doth not condemn that, but it muſt be with a peaceable frame and diſpoſition of ſpirit, and with an unwilling willingneſs, when men are forced to that way, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the priſoner of the Lord, beſeech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, and with long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Follow peace with all men;</hi> do all you can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and given himſelf for us.</hi> Do but conſider what a lovely thing would this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour appear to be, would Profeſſors but live up to theſe Rules, not to dare to do the leaſt wrong to others, but to bear the greateſt wrongs from others: to look upon our ſelves as obliged to do all the good we can to others, to the Souls, to the bodies, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what ſecurity can men have for all that is in danger by men, more than they have by theſe Principles? and what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance can they have of all the good men are capable of doing them, which theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples oblige thoſe that own this Doctrine to put in practice? Certainly it is only the want of living up to theſe Rules that brings this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine under ſuch contempt and reproach.</p>
            <p>Now as I have ſpoken of our adorning this Doctrine by our carriage in reference to God
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46197:108"/>and to all men in general; ſo I ſhould now come in the</p>
            <p n="3">3. How we muſt adorn this Doctrine by our carriage to our enemies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What ever injuries we meet with from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, this Doctrine teacheth us not to be our own avengers. How many unjuſt injuries did <hi>David</hi> ſuffer from <hi>Saul,</hi> and how often did God deliver <hi>Saul</hi> into his hands, in ſo much that <hi>his followers ſaid, the Lord hath delivered his life into thy hand;</hi> Now he is in thy power: O ſays <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.12. <hi>The Lord Judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee, but my hand ſhall not be upon thee.</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Moreover my Father, ſee, yea ſee, the skirt of thy robe in my hand,</hi> &amp;c. how often had <hi>David</hi> the like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to deſtroy <hi>Saul,</hi> but no ſaith he, <hi>God will avenge me, he will either fall in battle, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the hand of God will come upon him for his unrighteous dealings with me.</hi> So it is ſaid of our Saviour, who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not again; who when he ſuffer'd he threatnld not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly; he committed all to God This is that that we are taught by this Doctrine to commit all to God, and not to avenge our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To be ſo far from being overcome with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as to overcome evil with good. <hi>To pray for them that perſecure us, and deſpitefully uſe us:</hi> to be inſtruments of all the kindneſs we can to their Souls, who are inſtruments of all cruelties to our bodies. This was our Saviours temper,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46197:109"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father ſo give them, for they know not what they do:</hi> he pitied them and prayed for them, even then when they were acting all the cruelty they could againſt him; and he hath <hi>left us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> 1 Pet 2.21. Rom. 12.19, 20, 21. <hi>Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, avenge not you ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath, for it is written, Vengeance is mine and I will repay, ſaith the Lord; therefore if thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hunger, feed him; if he be thirſty, give him drink, for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> head: be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good:</hi> This would be a noble Principle in you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be ready to forgive them: it is an high expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi> O! how much hath God forgiven you, how many and how great were thoſe ſcores that you have run into with Divine Juſtice! hath God forgiven you for Chriſts ſake? think of that expreſſion when you find any thing of revenge ſtirring in your hearts. This is the Rule our Saviour preſcribes, that when ever we pray for pardon for our ſelves, we ſhould pray for it with a willingneſs to pardon others: <hi>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.</hi> They who expect forgiveneſs from God, and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forgive others, are never like to prevail in their requeſts: O what high engagements does this Doctrine lay upon us, and how lovely would this Doctrine appear to the world, if theſe Rules were but ſtrictly obſerved.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:46197:109"/>
            <p n="4">4. To love our enemies. This is a hard Doctrine: Nature teacheth us to love our Friends, but this goes higher, it teacheth us to love our Enemies. Herein we are required to ſhew our ſelves to be children of our Heavenly Father, <hi>Mat</hi> 5. <hi>If you love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the Publicans the ſame?</hi> verſ. 44. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that diſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you: that you may be the children of your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The Publicans were looked upon as the vileſt ſort of ſinners; yet theſe men came up to this good nature: but this Doctrine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to love our Enemies, and to do all the good we can to them, that labour to do all the evil they can to us. Indeed in ſome caſes our Saviour gives a diſpenſation; we muſt not caſt Perls before Swine, leſt they trample them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet; ſo not to throw theſe reproofs to them that will turn again and rend them.</p>
            <p>In a word, this Doctrine preſcribes to us, to do all we can to win our Enemies over to a liking of what they oppoſe: and thus as to our Enemies, as well as our Friends, we ſhould do what we can to commend the ways and ſervices of God to them, and to bring them into a love of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing, you may put to ſilence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh men.</hi> You ſhould by well doings, ſilence them that they may not be able to ſpeak againſt your perſons, or profeſſions, or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ſuch a carriage would be hugely to the advantage of the Goſpel.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:46197:110"/>
            <p n="3">3. A third head is this; Our carriage towards our Brethren, and fellow Chriſtians ſhould be ſuch as to adorn the Doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: and in reſpect of our carriage towards them, take this in general: Whatever friendly Office, whatever expreſſion of tenderneſs, and care we are to ſhew to men in general, and to Enemies, we are under a ſtricter obligation to ſhew the ſame to our fellow Chriſtians, though we are commanded <hi>to do good to all men,</hi> Gal. 6.26, <hi>yet eſpecially we are commanded to do good to the houſehold of Faith.</hi> The whole duty of man is ſummed up by our Saviour in this one word, <hi>Love.</hi> When the Lawyer came to Chriſt tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <hi>Maſter, which is the grace Commandment in the Law?</hi> verſ. 36, 37, <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets: our Saviour makes this duty of Love an univerſal duty. Some of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers thought Love was an univerſal affection and all the other affections but a diverſication of Love; Love branched out in different ways; and there is ſome reaſon in this. The reaſon why we have any thing is becauſe it oppoſeth what we love, and the reaſon why we grieve for any thing is, becauſe it ſtands between us and what our love is ſet upon: ſo I might ſpeak of all the other affections. But to be ſure this will hold in Love, to be a debt that we owe both to God and Man. This is the ſum of all the debts we owe, and this debt, though we are ſtill pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, yet we are ſtill owing it, eſpecially to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46197:110"/>the houſhold of Faith, our fellow Chriſtians 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22, 23. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>And whatſoever we ask we receive of him; becauſe we keep his Commandment:</hi> Obſerve the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are there mentioned in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as many as do theſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight: in <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And this is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (it is mentioned in the ſingular Number) <hi>that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another as he gave us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. A new Commandment</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>I leave with you, that ye love one another. [New:]</hi> Was it not old? Yes: But it is ſaid to be new upon a double account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is preſt upon us by new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and arguments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is commended to us by a new pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and example, ſuch an example of love as the world never had before, nor can ever have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Now the firſt and principal Object of our love is God himſelf, in whom is every thing that might attract our love; the next and ſecondary Objects of our love are all thoſe Creatures (which according to their degree) do participate of Divine excellencies: in this reſpect the Saints are ſtiled, <hi>The excellent in the earth,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> declares them to be, <hi>them in whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi> and therefore are excellent, becauſe they partake of, and are neerer in their reſemblance to the Divine nature than others, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given to us exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, whereby we are made partakers of the Divine nature;</hi> a high expreſſion: This is clear, this debt of love (though we owe it to all, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46197:111"/>ſhall be owing it while we live) yet we owe it eſpecially to our fellow Chriſtians, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Glory of God and the honour and credit of Religion is more concerned in their well doing; they are nearer to God than others are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe Chriſt takes all good offices that are done to them as done to himſelf; a full place to this purpoſe is that <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40. when Chriſt ſhall ſpeak encouragingly to them on his right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit a Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in as much a ye have done it to one of the least of theſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a ſpecial evidence of our ſincerity, our love to the Brethren, <hi>Hereby we know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is upon this account principally that God intruſts ſome of his ſervants with greater talents than others, that they may be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of expreſſing their love and tenderneſs to their Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. The Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Church of Chriſt to an organical body, a body that conſiſts of many members; and he ſpeaks of a diverſity of gifts, that thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are eudued with, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. but upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are theſe gifts given, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>It is given to every man to profit withal,</hi> to be uſeful with; not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enrich them, but to be imployed by them; there are ſome to whom God gives a larger ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of riches and worldly comforts; and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of parts, and abilities, gifts, and graces,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46197:111"/>but all is to profit withal: therefore as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, there are Chriſtians of divers ranks, and divers forms; ſome that are weak, but God hath inricht others with more ſtrength; ſome are ſtrong in grace and gifts, God gives thoſe talents to them, that they may by converſe help them that are weak, and have not their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſtrength and Grace, that all may be helpful one to another: thoſe that have leſs than others, ſhould provoke them that have more to thankfulneſs, and to have their bowels drawn out towards others that have need of their help. Conſider the many ſtrict obligations and bonds that Chriſtians are in one to another beyond what other Relations have, at leaſt how much more ſignificant thoſe Relations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; they are ſervants to one and the ſame Maſter, to wit, the Lord; <hi>We have one Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. they are of the ſame family and houſhould; nay, that is not all (though this obligeth us to a ſpetial degree of love) but they are Children to one Father, <hi>born from above, not of fleſh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> John 1.14. yet higher, <hi>they are members of one body,</hi> Col. 3.15. now there is a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that all the members have one of another; <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which alſo you are called in one body, and be thankful.</hi> This notion is improved to the full, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25, 26. <hi>That there ſhould be no Schiſme in the body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another.</hi> But you have a higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion than this, not only members of the ſame body, but members one of another: <hi>ver.</hi> 27.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46197:112"/>
               <hi>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;</hi> or, (as it is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46197:112"/>they did agree, they then laid aſide all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between them. You ſee upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it doth very much concern us to exerciſe this duty of love, eſpecially to our fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Walk in love as Christ alſo hath loved us, and given himſelf for us,</hi> Eph. 5.2</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> 1. In watching over them, to do what we can by way of prevention of what ever may be to their prejudice, or the diſhonour of Religion, or the wounding of their profeſſion; all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inſtances of the near relation that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſtand in one to another, implies a ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon all Chriſtians to this duty. Indeed God gives a ſpecial charge to them that have the overſight of the flock, that they eſpecially watch over them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Submit your ſelves to them that have the rule over you, for they watch for your Souls:</hi> Submit to them be counſelled, be guided by them in what they deſire according to the Rule of Gods word. <hi>Act</hi> 20.28.

The great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs of Chriſtians now ſhould be about the Souls of one another: this indeed is the trueſt love, the higheſt love, and comes neareſt to the love of God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In brotherly forbearance: the beſt Saints we can converſe with here upon the earth are but men, men cloathed with the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities with our ſelves; <hi>Elias</hi> was a man that mightily prevailed with God by prayer, <hi>James</hi> 5. and yet it is ſaid of him, he was a man of like paſſions. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnab as</hi> (thoſe eminent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whom the Heathen ſeeing to do ſuch ſtrange things would have worſhipped and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored) ſay of themſelves, <hi>We are men of like paſſions with your ſelves:</hi> the beſt of men have ſomething in them to witneſs they are but men, and as we ſtand in need of forbearance from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers our ſelves, ſo we are obliged on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt account to bear with others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2. <hi>With all lowlineſs, and meekneſs, and long ſuffering, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing one another in love, and ſo forgiving one another.</hi>

            <p n="4">4 By a tender ſympathy with them in their
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46197:113"/>miſeries, and in bearing their burdens, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their afflictions our own; and this you have expreſly commanded, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burdens in love.</hi> It was the ſin of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that he forgot the Afflictions of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But it is the great deſign of this Doctrine to perſwade all Chriſtians to a publick ſpiritedneſs: natural men may be pleaſant, and think that it is all well with them becauſe their own concerns are ſafe; but how was <hi>Eli</hi> concerned in the cauſe of God, and <hi>David</hi> in the concerns of <hi>Jeruſalem, If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning:</hi> This ſympathy muſt be an active ſympathy, adminiſtring to all the neceſſities of the Saints in all kinds, according to thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents God hath given to us, to adminiſter to the outward wants of others, if God hath given us of the good things of this world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>Who ſo hath this worlds goods and ſeeth his brother in need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In provoking one another to love and good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24 <hi>Conſider one another to provoke unto love and good works:</hi> the word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) is generally taken in a bad ſenſt, but here in a good, to wit, to excite, to ſtir up others to love and good works, and in our places to blow up thoſe ſparks of Graces that are in their Souls (what we can) into a flame; conſider one another, uſe all the wayes you can to put an edge upon others Affections to the things of God: Do what you can by your counſels and examples to provoke one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46197:114"/>other to love and good works, this is the only provocation that ſhould be found amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to labour by an holy emulation to excel in edification. In one word, we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our carriage towards towards our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to put on like bowels of compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that Chriſt hath to us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put you on therefore, Beloved, as to the elect of God (holy and beloved) bowels of mercies,</hi> &amp;c. And thus I have briefly gone over and ſhewed you how Chriſtians ſhould ſhew their thankfulneſs for the Goſpel, by labouring thus to adorn it in their carriage towards their Brethren, to carry it with ſo much love, eſpecially with love to their Souls.</p>
            <p>Now in the laſt place to ſhew you how we ſhould adorn the Goſpel in our exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to thoſe Rules that reſpect our carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves: for though there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command in all the Scripture that we ſhould love our ſelves, yet there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but implies it. For all the Commands of of the Second Table are built upon this, a love to our ſelves: <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> All the Commandments of the Second Table are built upon this foundation; this is to be the meaſure of our love to others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.17. It is a principle that is rooted in the nature of all Creatures, ſelf-preſervation, to be tender of any thing that is hurtful or prejudicial to that: This is above all Commands, the ground upon which all others are built; Therefore how ſhould we expreſs our love to our ſelves? I ſhall ſhew that in theſe 5 or 6 particulars.</p>
            <pb n="183" facs="tcp:46197:114"/>
            <p n="1">1. In denying our ſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>He that will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf:</hi> he muſt have ſo much love to God, as to hate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is contrary to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deny himſelf:</hi> How?</p>
            <p>His ſinful ſelf, that is his luſts and his vile affections by mortification: <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie therefore your members which are upon the earth,</hi> Col. 3.5. his ſinful ſelf he muſt deny abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and univerſally, and everlaſtingly in point of endeavour: <hi>Put ye off the old man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with his deeds: Crucifie the fleſh with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts thereof:</hi> to ſhew mercy to theſe ſinful affections, is to be cruel to our own Souls.</p>
            <p>Again, our natural ſelves that is our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts and enjoyments, we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves in theſe by a holy moderation at all times, and in having our affections looſe to them, to take heed ſo to love as not to over-love Creature enjoyments, and relations, and ſo to ſeek theſe things as not to over-ſeek them, but to exerciſe holy ſobriety and moderation, as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. And in ſome caſes we muſt deny our ſelves as to natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts when they prove to be an hinderance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our enjoying of them, and keeping cloſe to God, as in times of perſecution: it always falls out ſo, that we muſt either part with God, or Creature comforts, according as the degree of perſecution is; now we are commanded to deny our ſelves conditionally as to theſe things, that is, when God calls for theſe things at our hands, we muſt honour him with parting with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46197:115"/>liberty, and life, and all that is dear to us, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our wills to his will what ever it is, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of the Lord be done.</p>
            <p>Then our Religious ſelves we muſt deny; that ſelf that is in our duties, in our graces, not putting our truſt or confidence in them: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed his ſelf-denyal, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>I deſire not he found in mine own righteouſneſs:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was no ſmall proficient in the School of Chriſt, he was a man of high attainments, but he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all in point of truſt and confidence in them; he durſt not venture his hopes upon ſuch a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy foundation, he deſired not to be found in himſelf, but in the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith. As to our religious ſelves, it is true, we ſhould be as active in the exciting of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the exerciſe of them in every duty. as if the very acceptance with God did depend upon them, as if theſe were the foundation of all our hopes, evidences; but we ſhould look upon all as nothing, as to the putting any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them; as if we had done nothing at all: we are but unprofitable ſervants when we have done what is our duty, and we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing at the hands of God. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve as to our beſt ſelves, that is, our Souls, in point of care for them, there is no ſelf-denyal of this nature required; that is the Devils, ſelf-denyal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With ſelf Diſtruſt, and ſelf Jealouſie. This is the way to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour. We are very apt to be ſuſpicious of the ſafety of thoſe we moſt love, and diſtruſtful of every thing that may hazard them, and to be much concerned about them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46197:115"/>this out of his tenderneſs to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and his concernedneſs for their welfare, <hi>I am jealous over you,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>with a Godly jealoſie.</hi> So ſhould we be jealous of our own ſouls, and be keeping up a continual correſpondence with our ſelves, and not be ſtrangers at home: ſometimes counſelling and charging our ſouls with thoſe duties we are moſt prone to neglect. You find <hi>David</hi> often in diſtruſting himſelf, and therefore he checks himſelf for, and cautions himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every thing that he diſcovers of a ſinful carriage; and ſo ſhould we, thoſe temptations we are moſt likely to be endangered by, either from our diſpoſitions, or particular vocations or callings, or conditions we ſhould be cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelves againſt. This is that holy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie that we ſhould exerciſe over our ſelves. Now this will be an honour to Religion when we are careful to live up to our profeſſion, and are careful leſt our lives ſhould ſwerve from that ſtrait Rule that God hath ſet before us; and ſo to be encouraging our ſelves in thoſe duties of which we have been convinc'd, and in which we have taſted any refreſhment, thoſe duties eſpecially that are of greateſt weight and importance. We ſhould be exceeding jealous of our own ſluggiſhneſs, leſt our own warm affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions ſhould degenerate into chilneſs and our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in Religion ſhould degenerate into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality. Thus you find <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1, 5, 6. The great duty he is here exciting himſelf to and encouraging himſelf in, is the exerciſe of his Faith in all conditions, <hi>My ſoul truſt thou in God: My ſoul, I charge thee to make it thy buſineſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46197:116"/>to truſt in God more firmly.</hi> So what he ſpeaks to himſelf, he ſpeaks to others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times ye people.</hi> Such excitations every gracious Soul ſhould be much exerciſed in: they ſhould be jealous and diſtruſtful of themſelves, and preſs that home upon themſelves which St, <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth upon the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Philip. 4.8. <hi>Finally Brethren, whatſoever things are honeſt, just, pure, true, of good report, think on theſe things.</hi> Have your thoughts again and again upon them, think of the lovelineſs of them, commend them in the firſt place from your own practice, and then labour to engage others in the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Self watchfulneſs, and frequent ſelf reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To conſider how it is with us, &amp; to ponder all our ways. This is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the <hi>Pythagorians</hi> were notable for, out of a principle of ſelf jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: where have I been to day? what have I done to day? what good have I omitted? what evil have I committed? theſe kind of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions they did uſe to put to themſelves every night before they went to ſleep. Now this ſelf watchfulneſs ſhould expreſs it ſelf partly in keeping our hearts above all keepings, with all diligence, knowing how deceitful they are, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life</hi> Keep them as a man would keep his Treaſure, or as Soldiers a Gariſon from the aſſaults of all kind of Enemies, keep them as under lock and key, keep them as that thou knoweſt them to be apt continually to ſtart aſide. It was the Lamentation of the Church <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6. <hi>My Mothers Children are angry with me, they made me the keeper of the Vineyards, but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46197:116"/>my own Vineyard have I not kept.</hi> The Vineyard there meant was her own Soul, but my own Vineyard have I not kept. O keep your own hearts, this is the great depoſition that God hath committed to every mans keeping, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his Soul: the great thing that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted every man with. Though God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted our ſouls true with others in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet every man eſpecially hath the charge of his own Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.22 <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required at thy hands.</hi> It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at others hands, that neglect their duty, in warning and councelling thee, according to their places, but it ſhall be required eſpecially at thy hands: therefore our carriage towards our ſelves ſhould be in this watchfulneſs in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a care of our ſelves, as apprehending evils and dangers continually incompaſſing us; our whole life is continually ſubject to temptations, and when our temptations from Luſts and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions within are many, and when our hearts are like tinder, we had need then be watchful, both in doing what we can to keep our ſelves, and alſo commit our ſelves to Gods keeping.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Self ſeverity, and chiding our ſelves for all our neglects of God, that ever we ſhould be ſuch unworthy Creatures to requite God as we have done. How often doth <hi>Moſes</hi> upbraid the People of <hi>Iſrael, O fooliſh people and unwiſe, do you thus requite the Lord?</hi> Thus ſhould we deal with our ſelves, charging our ſelves with diſingenuity and ingratitude to that God who ſo highly deſerves from every one of us; <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I was as a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46197:117"/>bruit beaſt.</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, I was a perſecutor and blaſphemer, and injurious.</hi> This, and that, though God had forgiven them their ſins, yet they would not forgive themſelves, nor forget their offences againſt God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſhould walk humbly with God, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> 6.8. you have there a ſhort abridgment of mans duty when the Hypocrite was ſo large in his proffers (as thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſand Rivers of Oyle) no ſaith God, <hi>He hath ſhewed the, O man, what is good in his own eyes; to do Juſtice, to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> This is a great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive duty to walk in a ſenſe of our own weakneſs, and in a dependance on God; to look to him for direction to duty, and for ſtrength in duty, that we may not be miſtaken for want of direction, nor miſcarry for want of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Lastly,</hi> We muſt keep our ſelves in the love of God. This is the great Rule which St. <hi>Jude</hi> propounds, Epiſt. <hi>Jude</hi> 21. <hi>verſ. Keep your ſelves in the love of God.</hi> If you would do any thing in Religion to purpoſe, if either you would perſevere with conſtancy or make any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable progreſs in adorning the Doctrine of God our Saviour, you muſt keep your ſelves in the love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aplic.</hi> 1. By way of Reproof; if it be ſo that the great acknowledgment that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects for this eminent Mercy (the Goſpel) is that they ſhould adorn it: Then this reproves all that ſort of Profeſſors, that are a diſgrace, and reproach to this Doctrine; they profeſs it, but
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46197:117"/>they reproach it by their vicious carriages. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many there be that go under the name of Chriſtians. but yet are a diſhonour to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. <hi>Salvian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Eccleſia,</hi> often brings in the Heathen reproaching the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for their unſutable converſation to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, thereby giving occaſion to the Heathen to blaſpheme. Says he, <hi>Holy things would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be done by holy Perſons did their Teachers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them aright, and you may judge of him that is worſhipped by them that do worſhip him: How can he be a good Maſter whoſe Diſciples are ſo bad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerved at this day, that the Idolatrous practice of the Papiſts in worſhipping Images and Statues, is a great ſtumbling block to the Jews, and the chief impediment of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Chriſtianity: the Jews of old time were very much addicted to the ſin of Idolatry, but it is obſerved that after once they went into Captivity and were ſenſible that it was for that ſin, that God had ſo long caſt them off, they were a moſt averſe people to the ſin of Idolatry ever ſince. I might mention many Jewiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that mention this as the great ſtumbling-block to their Converſion: and ſo here, how many that are ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt are kept off from embracing this Doctrine of Chriſt from the intemperance and immorality of them that profeſs this Doctrine. Chriſtians who have but a dimmer light have ſcorned to do thoſe things that many Profeſſors have been guilty of in the face of the Sun, this is a reproach to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:46197:118"/>
            <p>There are five ſorts of perſons that I ſhall briefly ſpeak of by way of reproof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe worldly Profeſſors who lay about them for theſe earthly things, as if they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nothing at all of what they profeſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, Heaven, and their Souls, as if they expected no other happineſs but what brute Beaſts and Swine are capable of, as if they were acted by an Epicurean ſpirit, as if they minded what is preſent, and totally flighted what is future. <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die:</hi> What a great reproach is this to the Doctrine of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, eſpecially thoſe that are moral amongſt the Heathen; this teacheth us that our Souls are our trueſt good: but how many are there that live in a contradiction to this truth: their chiefeſt endeavour is to gratifie their ſenſes, to make proviſion for that part of theirs that is common with them to brute beaſts, I mean their bodies. This Doctrine teacheth us, that in our ſelves we are miſerable, and in Creatures our wants can never be relieved, and that our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs-conſiſts alone in God, and that the light of his countenance is more than Corn, Wine, and Oyl, and all that this world can afford: that in God alone we have all; and if we have not an intereſt in him, we have nothing but emptineſs in the midſt of fulneſs, and poor in the midſt of riches, and miſerable in the midſt of all our flouriſhing happineſs in outward things; this this Doctrine teacheth us, but worldly Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors cannot credit theſe truths; this Doctrine teacheth us to make Heaven our deſigne, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46197:118"/>Glory our aim, while <hi>we look not at the things that are ſeen, but the things which are not ſeen:</hi> to thoſe things that are inviſible to an eye of ſenſe, and to live by faith: now theſe Profeſſors that make the world their Idol, live in a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all theſe great truths that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine propounds as the Rule by which we ſhould walk through the whole courſe of our lives. God bids us make Heaven our deſigne, but worldly men make the world their deſigne: God bids us look after future happineſs, and corrupt nature bids us mind our preſent eaſe and ſafety and advantages: this is the way in which all the people of God have reached Heaven in ages paſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2 <hi>laſt verſes.</hi> So that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves all worldly Profeſſors, who are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to thoſe Principles that teach us to live by faith: Now a worldly heart lives by ſenſe, he cannot truſt God farther than he can ſee him; if theſe outward confidences are ſecured, then all is wel with him, but if he be in worldly ſtraits he can live no more by faith than what he hath in wordly ſupplies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This reproves all ſlothful and ſluggiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: indeed ſlothfulneſs is an unlovely thing in all perſons; ſlothful perſons are the very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the earth that they tread upon: a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then called ſlothfulneſs, <hi>The ruſt of the Soul:</hi> but ſlothfulneſs in Chriſtians of all perſons is moſt culpable; to be ſlothful in the ſervice of ſo good a Maſter, to be ſluggiſh in ſo encouraging a work is moſt highly to be blamed in thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians. You that have ſuch a gracious Lord to ſerve, you that have all
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46197:119"/>the encouragements that Servants can have, <hi>O be not ſlothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. <hi>and</hi> Rom. 12. <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> If there be any warmth or heat of our hearts and affections, certainly it ſhould be the things of God: Are other things deſirable? how much more are theſe: Can other things be refreſhing to us? how much more are theſe: and in ſuch caſes when all other things are uſeleſs: <hi>Riches avail not in the day of wrath:</hi> all worldly things are to no purpoſe; what is an eſtate to a pained body? to a man that is ſick? he will give all he hath for health and eaſe; how many things are there that mony cannot purchaſe, that great eſtates cannot procure, much more in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Souls; and therefore thoſe things that can only miniſter comſort to us in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtraits deſerve our higheſt diligence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that are ſlothful Profeſſors that are ſluggiſh in the ſervice of God, are a reproach to that good Maſter that they ſerve, to that bleſſed work in which they are engaged: God would not admit the Aſs to be offered up in ſacrifice to him under the Law, becauſe that Creature was an embleme of a ſlothful and ſluggiſh Profeſſor, who are of all Profeſſors the greateſt reproach to their profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This may reprove all luke-warm Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, what a reproach are theſe to Religion: do but conſider how zealous many are in undoing their Souls; how much more pains do they take to go to Hell, to pleaſe their Maſter the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46197:119"/>Devil, to undo their own Souls, than thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be engaged in a better work, in ſaving their Souls; What a reproach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is this to the Goſpel? it caſts a great contempt upon the profeſſion it ſelf, and upon all the Principles that are owned by ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This may reprove all proud and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Profeſſors: the great deſigne of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour is to abaſe man, and to exalt God; to lay man low, and to ſet God on high. Now they that think that they can do well enough by their own ſtrength, and can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties acceptable to God without more than an ordinary aſſiſtance, are to be reproved; pride was the firſt ſin that brought in all other ſins, and it is a coſtly ſin, it is that that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done us, and we have cauſe to lament it, till God ſhall compleat our deliverance from the relicts of it, though that will not be while we are in this world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This may reprove all diſheartened and diſconſolate Profeſſors, that move on uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in the ways of God. Obſerve it, God doth expect that all Profeſſors of his Name ſhould not only do his will, but alſo delight to do it; and not only to ſerve him, but ſerve him with chearfulneſs: How angry was God with his antient people, and ſeverely threatens them upon this account, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedst not the Lord thy God with gladneſs of heart in the abundance of all things, therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine enemies in the want of all things.</hi> God gives enough to anſwer all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and therefore he would have all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46197:120"/>his to go on with all alacrity and chearfulneſs is his ſervice. God loves a cheerful giver, and and he alſo loves a chearful doer, and a chearful ſufferer. In what work ſhould we not be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if not in the ſervice of ſo good a God?</p>
            <p>Now the more to ſet home this upon all thoſe perſons whom theſe ſeverall reproofs reach, I deſire you to conſider theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider how many ſober Pagans and Heathens have come nearer to this Rule of God our Saviour then all ſuch Profeſſors do: What reverence they have had to their Idol-Gods, and how highly they were concerned to ſhew the heigth of their reſpect to them? What a Controverſie was there at <hi>Epheſus</hi> among the chief Perſons concerning a Statue to <hi>Diana?</hi> One ſaid Marble was more eligible, becauſe it was more laſting; another that Alabaſter was more deſirable, becauſe it was more coſtly: they had that reſpect to thoſe falſe Gods which thy worſhipped, that they would ſerve them with the beſt. What a reproach then is it to Profeſſors, that they can be content to put off the true God with the worſt? to offer to him the blind and the lame, to offer that to him which they dare not offer to their Governour, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.8.</p>
            <p>Again, how many ſober Heathen have in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and moral honeſty gone beyond them that uſurp the name of Chriſtians. To be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and diſhoneſt? to be a Chriſtian and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate? to be a Chriſtian and to dare to give way to any kind of fraud, or any thing that is immoral? How much have Pagans forborn
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46197:120"/>theſe practices; nay, they have born witneſs againſt theſe with abhorrencie: What admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rules have we in <hi>Seneca</hi> concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, ſhewing that that is the trueſt generous ſpirit that contemns the world; theſe are low things, and theſe things cannot make a man happy, theſe cannot be the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of man.</p>
            <p>Again, with what evenneſs of ſpirit have they carried it in all conditions. Notable is that which <hi>Lucian</hi> reports concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Tyrant threatned him that he ſhould die; then, ſaid he, I am content to die: ſaid the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, thou ſhalt live; then ſaid he, I am content to live. I will acquieſce in whatever thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineſt to I ſhall not be diſpleaſed with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do. What an admirable even frame of ſpirit was this, that neither fears could daunt him, nor any thing diſcompoſe him? I could mention many notable inſtances of more than an ordinary courage, and undauntedneſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, according to that dimm light of theirs; they valued neither eſtates nor liberty, nor life in the defence of thoſe things they called vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. it is ſaid of hoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>That they having not a Law, are a Law to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond conſideration, how much doth God expect from you, more than others? you that profeſs to ſerve a higher Maſter, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in greater and better work than others. Therefore our Saviour preſſeth it upon them to be practiſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>What do you more than others? If you love your friends, the Publicans do
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46197:121"/>ſo; if you do good to them that do good is you, nature teacheth you to do ſo.</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doe you exceed others? Not to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, is to come exceeding ſhort of our duty, <hi>James</hi> 2.19. the Apoſtle ſpeaking to ſome that reſted in Orthodoxy in matters of Faith (indeed this is deſirable, but not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in) <hi>thou believeſt there is one God, thou doeſt well;</hi> this is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if thou reſt here, the Devils go thus far, <hi>they believe and they tremble:</hi> it is dangerous to come ſhort of them, who will yet certainly come ſhort of Heaven. <hi>Matth</hi> 25. in the Parable of the Maſter who had diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral Talents among his Servants, you find that he was accounted a faithful Servant whoſe improvements were anſwerable to his receipts: God hath done more for you than for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then part of the world: I have ſhewed you what a great priviledge it is to enjoy this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God our Saviour, he expects that you ſhall proportionably adorn it, that you ſhould ſhun the appearance of evil, and hate the Garments ſpotted with the fleſh, that you ſhould ſhun all temptations to ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider what a glory former Chriſtians that have outdone all other kind of men beſides, in obſerving the Rules of the Goſpel, have been to this Doctrine of God our Saviour. O what Heroick Spirits were the Primitive Chriſtians, who could rejoyce in tribulations, and ſuffer the ſpoyling of their goods with joy, and that could with chearfulneſs undergo any miſery, when the caſe was clear indeed (when the caſe was doubtful, the caſe was different) then how
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46197:121"/>they counted Godlineſs great gain, though it was loaded with reproaches, and loſſes, and all worldly inconveniencies, yet they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it the moſt profitable eourſe that could be taken, and when they were deſtitute of all Creature-comforts, yet they could be content with this, and triumph in this, <hi>the teſtimony of their own Conſciences.</hi> When the world was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and the ſpirits of men were imbittere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when earth and hell was againſt them, yet then to be albe to approve their hearts to God, this was enough to bear up their ſpirits, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſations in the world.</hi> And ſo much for the firſt Uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is by way of Exhortation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all to make this their full work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our conſtant deſigne and aim. And oh! what bleſſings might we be to after-ages in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon this work to purpoſe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Write henceforth, bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, and their works do follow them:</hi> it is ſaid the ſins of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men do follow them, and the good works of the righteous do follow them; the good they have done to others ſhall be ſpread before others in after generations, ſo that their good works may be augmenting and increaſing many years after they are in their Graves. And thus I find a Learned Writer interpreting both thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, concerning wicked mens ſins following after them, when all the ſins (that they in their own perſons are guilty of) are accounted for, they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46197:122"/>ſhall have other mens ſins as an after-reckoning. For every man does many miſchieſs in the world; for by bad exaple he may infuſe thoſe corrupt Principles into others which may out live his Perſon, and flouriſh when his body is rotting in the grave: Be perſwaded therefore to make it your great deſigne to adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour: there is no man ſo mean, but he is in a capacity in his place to do it; and the Apoſtle propounds it here in the Text to the meaneſt rank of perſons, to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that they may do it. I ſhall only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome few weighty Arguments to engage you in this work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider your Principles are higher than others: What are the Principles of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? I anſwer, Faith and Love: Faith that lifts us up above the things of ſenſe, above what is preſent, what is viſible to an eye of ſenſe. The <hi>Juſt,</hi> are ſaid, <hi>to live by Faith, Heb.</hi> 10.28. Faith lifts us up above our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſts, above our ſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the World: it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſhaphat, that his heart was lifted up in the ways of God:</hi> it is Faith lifts up the Soul above all rubs and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments: now every Chriſtian profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Believer; where is your faith then, as our Saviour upbraided his Diſciples, that you are ſo nonpluſt with every difficulty, and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at every danger, and are interrupted in the ways of God upon every diſcouragement? Where is your Faith?</p>
            <p>The other Principle of a Chriſtian is that of love; <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Love ſweetens every thing; we are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46197:122"/>content to go through hardſhips, and to paſs through difficulties, to hazard our felves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous encounters, if it be for the ſake of them we love, or if it be in the purſuit of what we love. Now theſe that are acted from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Faith in God, and love to Chriſt that feel the conſtraints of his love lying upon their hearts what manner of perſons ought they to be that make ſuch a high profeſſion as this?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As your Principles are higher, ſo your pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern is better than others: they have not any of thoſe Rules that you heard mentioned in the large explication of the Doctrine; but thoſe Rules have been exemplified in the pattern of our Lord Jeſus, in that bleſſed example that he hath given us. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him ought himſelf alſo to walk as he walked,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. to make him his pattern, and to follow him in all things that are imitable: true, ſome things Chriſt did as God, in thoſe things he is not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and ſome things he did as God-man, as Mediator, in thoſe things he can have no follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, none to imitate him. But ſome things he did as he was a holy perſon, now what his life was, ſuch ſhould ours be; what the life of Chriſt was, I ſhall only hint ſome few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The life of Chriſt was the moſt ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life that ever was: we read of the ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and we have two notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it; He obeyed the Call of God, and left his own Country and friends, and kindred, and acquaintance he went he knew not whether, nor to whom, yet God calls, and he obeys. — God again calls to <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Child of ſo many prayers, and a Son
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46197:123"/>of ſo many Promiſes, and he in whom all the Inhabitants of the earth were to be bleſſed; yet God requiring him to offer no that Son he dares not with-hold him. So we read of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſelf-denial, <hi>He refuſed to be called the Son of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs daughter</hi> Now the ſelf-denial of Chriſt was ſuch as the beſt of men were ever capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. If you conſider the matters wherein he denied himſelf; he denied himſelf of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which no Creature was in a poſſibility of enjoying what was his Glory? he thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this Glory to be obſcured and clouded, and was contented with it in order to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his Fathers deſigne of mercy to poor ſinners; the glory he left was ſuch as no Cretature was capable of, and the miſery he underwen was ſuch as no Creature eould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt under.</p>
            <p>Again, the life of Chriſt was a pure and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life; there was <hi>no guile found in his mouth,</hi> he was ſair without ſpot, the Lamb of God without ſpot, he was a man not only free from ſinful practices, but in whom there was nothing of a ſinful Principle, and therefore nothing could diſturb him; all the temptations of Satan, all the allurements of the world could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him: Satan (when he aſſaulted him) found nothing in him to faſten his temptations upon; under the ſoreſt of his aſſlictions there was found nothing in him of impatience, but ſtill he was as a ſheep before the ſhearers, that was dumb and opened not his mouth; but when his Name was reproached, and his perſon contemned, and his Soul afflicted, when he was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46197:123"/>under all thoſe agonies and pains, he neither brake out againſt Inſtruments, nor againſt God, but patiently endured all.</p>
            <p>Again, the moſt high and liſtinguiſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that God his Father ſhewed to him as the Son of his love, and that Son of his <hi>in whom his Soul alone delighted,</hi> could not lift him up, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions could not fink him, ſo neither could theſe tranſport him; as the one could not caſt him down, ſo nither could the other lift him up. Alas! it is hard for us to be in a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to keep our hearts humble; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great favour that God ſhewed him in his Baptiſme, when the Angel deſcended in the ſhape of a Dove, and by that voyce from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> yet how humbly and how evenly did he carry it under all varieties of occurrences that he met with here upon earth.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſtrongeſt temptations could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle him; when Satan came with his large proffers, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> he anſwered him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, for it is written, thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Lond thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> The greateſt oppoſitions could not abate his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or make him the more remiſs; neither the oppoſition of enemies, nor the miſtaken Counſels of friends (as <hi>Peter, Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf</hi>) could take him off from his duty, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was ſo full and compleat, that he left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unfulfilled of all that God commanded him, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> I might ſhew the activeneſs and uſefulneſs of the life of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46197:124"/>Chriſt, and what a notable example we have in all reſpects of his burning zeal for Gods glory; and his melting compaſſions towards poor Souls, and his ſtooping to the meaneſt offices in order to his peoples good; and his preferring the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good to others, before his enjoying all the good of the world; thus you ſee as our Principles are higher, ſo our pattern is better.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your engagements are ſtronger than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are; other creatures are beholding to God for their beings, for he made them, and for their continuances in their beings, he keeps their breath in their no ſtrils; they are beholding to God for, their daily bread and outward comforts; but the engagements of Chriſtians are far greater than all theſe outwards mercies, though theſe are great. Conſider the great things that God hath done for them in ſpiritual things, in ſanctifying their hearts with Grace; this is a bleſſing that makes every thing a bleſſing to us; to the pure all things are pure, if God hath once ſeaſoned our hearts with Grace in ſanctifying them, our Comforts are ſanctified. at leaſt in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: for what is the ſanctification of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but only a bility to diſcharge thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that thoſe comforts enjoyn us to, that is to be faithful in ſerving God with them. In ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our hearts, our afflictions are ſanctified: now what is the ſanctifying of our afflictions but the improving of them to the good of our Souls, and the Glory of God: nay, in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our hearts all the Ordinances and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that we partake of are ſanctified, we make a ſanctified uſe of all. O what a great
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46197:124"/>mercy is this! ſuch were ſome of you, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>But ye are ſanctified.</hi> You were in the loweſt rank of ſinners, but you are now in the higheſt form of Creatures; <hi>you are ſanctified by the Spirit of God.</hi> It is the work of ſanctification that makes the great difference between perſevering and Apoſtate Angels, this is that that makes an everlaſting difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Souls of ſome, and the Souls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſome are born in ſin, and live and die in ſin, and periſh for ever for their ſins; all are born in ſin indeed, but ſome are recovered out of the power of ſin by the work of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; now what a wonderfull mercy is this? ſo I might inſtance in the work of Conveſiron, &amp; in the work of the Juſtification of our Perſons, this is another Priviledge that God hath inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us in: and O how great a priviledge is this? <hi>David</hi> pronounceth him a bleſſed man, <hi>whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.</hi> And then God adopts them to be his Sons; they who were enemies are made ſriends by Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they that were ſtrangers are made Sons by adoption, and have the priviledge of Sons, that is boldneſs of acceſs to God as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Again, every ſincere Profeſſor is made an heir, not only a Son of God, but alſo on Heir of Heaven; and how great a Priviledge is this? What ever our Condition is in this World, yet all this will end in heaven, &amp; glory, &amp; happineſs. Then is the unſpeakable aggravation of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the moſt flouriſhing ungodly man in the world, whatever his condition is as to riches and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46197:125"/>greatneſs, and all the grandure he is capable of, yet all this will end in Hell; but the ſincere Soul (though it lives under reproaches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and ſcorns, and all things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely to fleſh and blood? ſhall have Heaven at laſt, for they are heirs of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Your encouragements are greater, than the encouragements of others: it is a great word that the Apoſtle hath to all ſincere Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in the 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come;</hi> it hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Earth and Heaven; How great an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is this? we ſhall want nothing that is good for us, that God ſees convenient; we ſhall have no more of trouble and affliction that when God ſees convenient and needful for us; for a little time if need be ye are in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: we ſhall have no more loads nor weights upon us but what we ſhall have aſſiſtance from God to ſupport us under: God hath engaged that we ſhall meet with no more difficulties in his ſervice, but what he will carry us through. And then as to the other world all ſhall tend to their happineſs there. Now what an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort is this? Alas! this life is a life of vanity at the beſt; nay, this life is many times mixt with vexation in the beſt: but to think of future Glory one would wonder there ſhould be any thing of remiſsneſs or ſlightneſs in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods expectations from you are higher than others: <hi>To whom much is given of them much is required.</hi> God hath done ſo much for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46197:125"/>for you already, and hath promiſed ſo much to you hereafter, that he expects you ſhould live, not at the rate of other perſons, but above them, and to outſtrip them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Your dangers are greater if you be not faithful: all they that enjoy the Goſpel and do not anſwer the engagements of the Goſpel, are ſo far from being better than others, that it is worſe with them than others. The wrath of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> Rom. 1.18. To the Jew firſt, becauſe their light was clearet, and they had greater priviledges than others; and ſo thoſe Cities to whom the Goſpel came, <hi>Wo to thee Corazin, wo thee Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Marth.</hi> 11.22. You have been lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven in reſpect of the means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but you ſhall be caſt down to Hell in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the puniſhment, becauſe of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs and unthankfulneſs for theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; becauſe you have received the Grace of God in vain.</p>

            <p>IN the words we have that <hi>full Contentment,</hi> and that compleat ſatisfaction which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took <hi>in God alone.

David</hi> had in former times been ſtript at once of all his Comforts; it was the ſaddeſt condition that ever that holy man was it, which we find recorded, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 30 6. when <hi>David</hi> was not only beniſhed from <hi>Jeruſalen,</hi> and from amongſt the people of God; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taken ſhelter under <hi>Achiſh</hi> the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> Lords complain againſt him, ſo that he muſt to longer abide there neither; the only place that was left him was a little <hi>Zoar</hi> (<hi>Zig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag,</hi> I mean) and when he thinks to retire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Amalekites</hi> were come and had taken away his ſubſtance; and (which was worſe) his wives and all that he had in the world was gone; and that which added ſtill to his grief was, that thoſe few followers which were yet with him, ſpake of ſtoning of him: but though his caſe was very ſad, yet he comforts himſelf <hi>in the Lord his God.</hi> And let our caſe be whatever it will, our care ſhould be to get an intereſt in God, and to comfort our ſelves in him.</p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:46197:126"/>
            <p>It is in a very high ſtrain that <hi>David</hi> begins this Pſalm with, and the more abrupt and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the expreſſions ſeem to be, the more <hi>Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> and affectionate they are. <hi>I will love thee, O Lord my ſtrength: The Lord is my Rock, my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and my Deliverer: My God, in whom I will teust, my Buckler, and the horn of my Salvation, and my Tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is morthy to be praiſed,</hi> &amp;c. Here are expreſſions upon expreſions, his heart was full, and he ſcarce knew how to give his thoughts ſufficient vent, in admiring and adoring the goodneſs of God to him. Now leaſt theſe high confidences that <hi>David</hi> had in God, ſhould ſeem to be no better than ſome raſh, and haſty raptures: he lays down the ground of theſe confidences in the reiterated experiences he had had of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to him, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5.6. and ſo on. <hi>The ſorrows of Death compaſſed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid: the ſorrows of Hell compaſſed me about, the ſnares of death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me. In my diſtreſs I called upon the Name of the Lord, and cried to my God, he heard my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears; then the earth ſhook and trembled,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need to trouble you with the ſeveral Opinions of Interpreters particularly what his diſtreſſes then were; but in general it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, That his diſtreſſes were ſuch, that if God had not helped him, none elſe could; and when he had none other comforter or help left, none elſe to depend upon, then he cries to God, and he doth not cry in vain; and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46197:127"/>ſo you find him in another diſtreſs he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the 16, 17, 18. verſes of this Pſalm, <hi>He ſent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters</hi> (that is many afflictions) <hi>he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me from my ſtrong enemy, and from them that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, for they were too ſtrong for me:</hi> Relating to <hi>Saul</hi> (as you may ſee, if you compare that place with the Preface of he Pſalm.) <hi>They prevented me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my ſtay, he brought me forth alſo into a large place, he delivered me becauſe he delighted in me</hi> Now here <hi>David</hi> comforts himſelf in his ſincerity, though he doth not ſpeak as a ſelf-Juſtificiary, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the leaſt of a Phariſaical temper, as if he thought he merited any thing from the hands of God: yet it was his comfort, in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlef, that <hi>God had owned his uprightneſs</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him in thoſe dangers; and it is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he gives to others; he gives alſo cautions to wicked men, for 'tis very obſervable in this Pſalme, that when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>his</hi> Experiences and <hi>Comforts</hi> in God, he frequently intermixes his <hi>Cautions</hi> to the Enemies of God; that if they would deal frowardly, God would deal frowardly with them. But then to <hi>encourage</hi> the people of God, ſays he, <hi>With the merciful theu wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful, with the upright man thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf upright, and with the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure.</hi> In the words we have the reſult that <hi>Davids</hi> thoughts came too <hi>(The Lord liveth)</hi> he had ſeen how much of vanity and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment there was in all Creature comforts: many of his people had been time after time
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46197:127"/>knockt off from them; but ſays he, <hi>(the Lord lives)</hi> and therefore here he ſits down, here he is reſolved to fix.</p>
            <p>In theſe words be theſe three particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a Declaration of what God is <hi>in himſelf,</hi> he <hi>is the living God. (The Lord lives.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A Deſcription of what God is <hi>to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: (And bleſsed be my Rock) A Rock</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes ſtrength, fafety, protection; God doth often ſet forth his goodneſs to his people under this Metabhor; He is ſaid to be a Rock higher than all waves, a ſhelter from all ſtorms: their Fortreſſes of old were uſually built upon Rocks, that ſo the acceſſes of the Enemy might be the more difficult; and therefore they were looked upon as places of the greateſt ſecurity. <hi>Their Rock is not as our Rock even our Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being Judges,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes;</hi> Deut. 32.31.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is <hi>Davids magnifying</hi> and <hi>admiring of God,</hi> upon this double conſideration, both of what <hi>God is in himſelf,</hi> and of what he is <hi>to his people. (The Lord liveth, and bleſſed be my Rock, and let the God of my Salvation be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.)</hi> He is careful to comfort himſelf in this God, and he would have others follow his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>Doct. That <hi>'tis the admirable ſuppore of the people of God, that when friends die, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts fail, yet God lives,</hi> yet the Lord Lives. <hi>You Fathers where are they? and the Prophets do they live for ever?</hi> Zech. 1.5. Thoſe Relations that are moſt comfortable, and who uſe to have the moſt care in them for us, yet theſe are fading Relations. <hi>Your Fathers where are they?</hi> Nay, thoſe Relations that are moſt uſeful, not in <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:46197:128"/>reſpects only, but alſo in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> theſe are dying perſons, <hi>The Prophets do they live for ever?</hi> But when all our Creature-comforts die and vaniſh, <hi>yet the Lord lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things that I ſhall ſpeak to in the opening of this obſervation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The firſt is this, <hi>That the Lord whom we ſerve is the living God;</hi> he lives: This Title I ſhall ſhew, how far it is appropriated to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Creatures whatſoever.</item>
               <item>2. That as he is the living God, ſo <hi>he lives as Lord.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. How much <hi>this is to the ſupport</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>of all his people.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That however all other Creatures may be dying, yet <hi>God liveth:</hi> all thoſe Names by which God hath made himſelf known in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do ſtrongly imply this Truth. That great Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is ſo often mentioned in Scripture, ſignifies, <hi>A God of Being,</hi> a God that gives being to all other Creatures, and a God that is the Fountain of Being in himſelf. When God ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> upon that difficult Errand, of treating with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> about the releaſing <hi>If<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of their for bondage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. this is the Name by which God makes himſelf known <hi>(I am that I am hath ſent thee)</hi> that is, I that alone am, the name by which the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſpake of their God <hi>Zena, quſia</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as one gloſſes upon that Name) that is, they thought him to be a living God. But to be ſhort, We find that God is often ſtiled in Scripture, <hi>the living God,</hi> to denote him to be <hi>the true God.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.4. when <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> came, and put
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46197:128"/>
               <hi>Hezckiah</hi> into thoſe fears, he ſends to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to pray to the Lord, <hi>It may be,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabſhekah, whom, the King of Aſsyria his Maſter, hath ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the living God,</hi> that is, <hi>the true God.</hi> So when <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth his earneſt affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in deſiring Communtion with God, he ſpeaks of him as <hi>the living God,</hi> Pſalm 42.2. <hi>My Soul thirſheth for God, for the living God,</hi> that is, for <hi>the true God: When ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> And ſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 84.2. <hi>My Soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the Coaſts of the Lord: my heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God.</hi> And ſo the Prophet <hi>Joremiah</hi> parahpraſing a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this word, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10.10. <hi>But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlaſting King, at his wrath the earth ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Nations ſhall nto be able to abide his indignation,</hi> he is <hi>the living God,</hi> and this is the Argument to prove him to be the <hi>true God.</hi> So <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. when <hi>Darius</hi> had been ſurprized in the Decre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> and had conſented una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares to his being caſt into the Den of Lyons, he came to the Den, and cried with a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voyce, unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> and ſpake, ſaying, <hi>O Danicl, Servant of the living God, is thy God whom thou ſerveſt continually able to deliver thee from the Lions?</hi> He is a God indeed. But farther he is often ſtiled <hi>the living God,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>dead Idols,</hi> which were the Gods of the Heathen. So you have a notable deſcription of thoſe Idols which the ſinners of that age did worſhip. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. and ſo on. <hi>But our God he is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he hath done whatſoever he pleaſed, their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46197:129"/>are ſilver and gold; the works of mens hands, they have mouths but they ſpeak not, eyes have they but ſee uot, they have ears but hear not, noſes have they but they ſmell not, they have hands but they handie not, feet have they but they walk not, neither ſpeak, they through the throat, but our God is the living God.</hi> Again, he is ſtiled the <hi>living God</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>dying men,</hi> as Magiſtrates are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtiled Gods, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.6. <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods, but ye ſhall die like men,</hi> and ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.26. <hi>For who is there of all fleſh, that hath heard the voice of the living God, ſpeaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</hi> When God would give his people the greateſt aſſurance of the certain accompliſhment of his promiſes, he ſpeaks in this language, <hi>as I live,:</hi> he ſwears by his own life. So you have it <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.18. <hi>Lift up thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But I have ſufficiently cleared this from Scripture. You ſee then all along, that God in Scripture is ſtiled <hi>the living God,</hi> and it is ſuch a kind of life as no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of, that is here aſcribed to God, and that I ſhall ſhew in theſe 5 particulars.</p>

He is the <hi>Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46197:132"/>without beginning or and of days:</hi> that is ſpoken of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt thing propounded to be ſpoken to, That <hi>the God whom we own, and whom we ſerve, is the living God:</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>dead Idols,</hi> and <hi>all dying Creatures.</hi> He lives <hi>originally</hi> from himſelf. <hi>Intirely of himſelf. Perfectly</hi> in the enjoyment of himſelf. He lives <hi>immntably,</hi> and he lives <hi>eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second thing was, That <hi>he lives as Lord,</hi> (that is) as God exerciſing his <hi>Dominion over all things</hi> both in Heaven and earth, and this you find very frequently mentioned in Scripture. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1. It is ſpoken by way of comfort, and of awakening to the wicked: ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.3, The Mediatory Kingdom <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his Father, he had <hi>all power commus nicated to him,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>God hath exalted him above all, and made him the head of all,</hi> Eph 1.21, 22, 23. This Kingdom of Chriſt is ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on him, that he ſhall rule ſo long as there is <hi>one Enemy</hi> remaining <hi>to be ſubdued,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26, 27. and as long as <hi>one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſon</hi> is <hi>to be called</hi> in, preſerved, and taken care of in this world, Chriſt retains his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and when theſe things are finiſhed, Chriſt reſignes his Kingdom into his Fathers hands, and God becomes <hi>all in all:</hi> and he lives <hi>as Lord,</hi> to <hi>make good all his Promiſes</hi> to his people, and to fulfil his <hi>threatings</hi> againſt his Enemies. Now conſider how large a <hi>Treaſure the Promiſes are,</hi> ſuch, as we cannot deſire any bleſſing beyond what the Promiſes do contain. As to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life, what can we deſire more than
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46197:132"/>God promiſes? God promiſes we ſhall have ſo much of this world as is for our good; and would you have that which is for your hurt? this was a raſh deſire. God hath promiſed to free us from ſo much evil in this world, as our condition can be ſafe without; afflictions ſhall be for a little time if need be, no more and no longer ſhall our afflictions continue, then what is needful, and ſo long as we need them, they ſhall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How is this for the ſupport and <hi>comfort of Gods people</hi> that <hi>God lives?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, if we conſider <hi>what God is,</hi> there is enough in this to ſo ſpeak it highly to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his People. Look upon God in thoſe excellencies by which he hath made known himſelf to his poor Creatures, and this muſt needs be greatly to their ſupport and comfort, though all other comforts ſhould be taken from from them; <hi>God is the Fountain of all good,</hi> and there is that infinite fulneſs in him, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our wants be, yet there is enough in his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſupply us. Though our wants are far more, and greater than we are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, yet they are not too great for infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſupply. We want all thoſe mercies by which God hath commended his love to poor Creatures, there is not one ſingle mercy, either pardoning, or purging, or ſealing mercy which we need not. But our comfort is, we cannot need that mercy, but there is enough in God for our relief, according to our particular caſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the Fountain of all bleſſings, the <hi>God of all conſolation,</hi> the Giver of <hi>every good gift.</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:46197:133"/>He is the Fountain of his own perfections, and he is the Fountain of all the Excellencies that are amongſt the Creatures: the very Angels themſelves do but ſhine with a borrowed light: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi> Nay, he is <hi>a full Fountain,</hi> an <hi>Eternal</hi> Fountain that can never be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or drawn dry. Though God hath been thouſands of years communicating good to his Creatures, and that in divers ways, yet he is as full as ever. We have ſome Reſemblances of this in Nature. Though the <hi>Sun</hi> hath been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledging the world with its light for ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years, yet the Sun is as full of light as ever. And the Sea, though it hath been ſo long ſupplying the ſtreams, yet is as full of water as ever: yet all theſe Reſemblances are but dark Repreſentations, and ſhadows of that infinite fulneſs and excellencie that is in God. Alas! theſe Creature helps are but like leaking veſſels and <hi>broken Ciſterns,</hi> ſo <hi>Jeremiah</hi> compares them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For my people have committed two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, they have forſaken me the fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, and howed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns that can hold no water:</hi> they are but <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns,</hi> and therefore cannot hold much, and they are <hi>broken</hi> Ciſterns, and therefore cannot hold what they have long; all our Creature-comforts are but like <hi>Hagars bottle</hi> that will be ſoon emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dry, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.15. But now, though God hath beſtowed millions of bleſſings upon his people, yet he hath as many bleſſings in ſtore for them as ever. None ſhall have cauſe to ſay to him as <hi>Eſan</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with tears, <hi>Haſt thou but
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46197:133"/>one bleſſing, my Father, bleſs me, even me alſo, O my Father.</hi> The Name by which God made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known to <hi>Abraham</hi> was this, <hi>I am God All-ſufficient, Gen.</hi> 17.1. and what greater thing can be ſaid than this <hi>All-ſufficient.</hi> Let our caſe be what it will; ſuppoſe we are ſtript of all our comforts, God hath taken away a moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Child, a moſt loving Husband, a moſt faithful friend, one that hath been in all reſpects very helpful, both to our Souls, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of our lives heretofore; yet what is all this to the All-ſufficiencie of God? if we look upon upon him as <hi>God All ſufficient,</hi> and conſider this <hi>God ſtill lives,</hi> though the Ciſtern may be dry, yet the Fountain is open, though Creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts may be gone, yet God is ſtill where he was, this muſt needs be a ground of Comfort to the people of God.</p>
            <p>Again, Look upon God not only as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all good, but as the <hi>Sum and Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe</hi> of all good; and this muſt needs be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to his people; for whatever is of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in any Creature muſt needs be much more in God, for God that makes any Creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us, can in the abſence of that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture communicate the ſame comfort to us from himſelf. Obſerve it according to that old Rule, <hi>That which makes any thing ſuch, muſt needs it ſelf be more ſuch.</hi> The Schoolmen ſpeak of three ways by which we may come to the knowledge of God. The firſt is by way of <hi>Cauſality,</hi> when we take notice of thoſe various excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are ſcattered up and down in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all theſe meet in God, yea, and meet
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46197:134"/>in him without the leaſt mixture of thoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections wherewith they are clogg'd in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but that's not all. Secondly, they are all in God by way of <hi>Infiniteneſs.</hi> Is a friend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable? God is a friend beyond all friends. Is a faithful <hi>Counſellor</hi> a great help? what help can you liken unto God? in reſpect of his Being, ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.18. <hi>To whom will you liken me?</hi> where is the perſon, or that friend who can do that for you, which I have done, and am ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do? Do you look upon <hi>eaſe</hi> as a great priviledge, there's no ſuch eaſe as that which God gives; he gives eaſe to troubled minds, peace to wounded Conſciences. Nay, is <hi>life</hi> it ſelf deſirable? you read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. God is much more deſirable: in life and death God is deſirable. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life:</hi> he had rather die in the favour of God, than live in a condition of eſtrangement from God. Alas! what is the light of a Candle to the light of the Sun? God is (in the abſence of all Creature-comforts) not only as good as thoſe comforts would be, but he is much better to them; as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah, Am not I better to thee than ten Sons?</hi> 1 Sam. 1.8. When the people of God do leave no leſs than their all here below, they leave Friends, Relations, Acquaintance, their Creature-enjoyments, they part with all at once, and do you think they are any loſers by it, when they go to the enjoyment of God alone? For it is ſaid in Heaven, <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> there they have all made up in God. But then farther, look upon God not only as the Fountain and Quinteſſence of all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46197:134"/>good, but look upon him as the <hi>ſupreme diſpoſer</hi> of all things in the world, and this <hi>God yet lives;</hi> though we have enemies, and dangers, and wants; and though we have not the Counſel of the friend we had before, nor the inſtruction of thoſe Miniſters we had, by whom formerly we have been refreſhed, yet ſtill that God lives who hath the diſpoſal of all things in the world in his own hands; inſomuch there is not a hair falls from our heads without the will of our Father. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.37. <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The truth is, moſt of the troubles that we undergo here on earth, they are troubles we make to our ſelves; and amongſt others, this is one, by placing our Comforts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing on this ſide God; in doing thus, we bring our ſelves under an abſolute neceſſity of diſappointment; for if we will lean upon a <hi>broken Reed,</hi> that Reed will be weak &amp; cannot ſupport us; &amp; if we will build upon a <hi>ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> that ſandy foundation muſt needs fall, when the winds and ſtorms of trouble do ariſe, Let me therefore leave this with you, he that builds his hopes, and places his comforts upon any thing that is dying and fading, this man <hi>brings himſelf under an abſolute neceſſity of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> I herefore (ſays <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>the hope of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh,</hi> Job 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But that's not all, in placing our hopes upon any thing beſides God, we do highly <hi>provoke God,</hi> and put our ſelves very much <hi>out of his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> for if we think our ſelves ſafer in the hands of Creatures than in the hands of God, and happier in the enjoyment of Creatures than in the enjoyment of God, what a diſparagement do we hereby put upon God? This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affront we can offer him. The truth is, we can neither prudently, nor well fix upon any thing but God. Says <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. when he had many troubles, <hi>I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:46197:138"/>and whom I have truſted, I know where to fix my hopes and expectations, and this my ſupport. Now whenever we go from God, we go to <hi>our loſs,</hi> for in going from him, let us go where we will, we do but go from <hi>fulneſs</hi> to <hi>emptineſs,</hi> and from <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>weakneſs</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Doct. <hi>They who are dearly beloved, may nevertheleſs be deeply afflicted. David</hi> was ſorely diſtreſſed. <hi>David</hi> his very name in Hebrew ſignifies <hi>Beloved;</hi> a man of whom God himſelf
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46197:141"/>gives that ample teſtimony, <hi>that he was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> after his own heart,</hi> Acts 13.22. and yet how ſore were his afflictions? <hi>Saul</hi> and his Souldiers had baniſhed him not only out of the City of Jeruſalem, but out of the Coaſts of Iſrael; in order to his ſafety, he is forced to ſeek ſhelter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the uncircumciſed, nor can he long be ſafe there neither, the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtnes</hi> work him out of favour with <hi>Achiſh</hi> their King, <hi>David</hi> muſt now be packing, the only retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>Zoar</hi> he had, was <hi>Ziklag:</hi> his friends who had formerly comforted him, are now in Captivity, his City a ruinous heap, all that was now left was only ſome ſmall retinue, and even thoſe though they had formerly been not only his Companions, but his Comforters in all his afflictions, yet now inſtead of ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with him, they threaten to kill him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe themſelves were diſtreſſed with him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bemoaning him, and bringing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to quench the fire of his ſorrow, they do but bring fewel to enflame his grief the more. The inſtance is full. Let me add the inſtance of the whole collective body of Gods people here on earth, in all Ages it hath been generally thus with them, the primitive Profeſſors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37, 38. <hi>of whom the world was not worthy.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the only beloved of the Father was yet <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs.</hi> Conſider his groans, his cries, his drops of blood; and 'tis clear therefore, that whom God dearly loves, he may and does ſometimes deeply afflict, not onely equally with others, but many times above others. But for the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46197:141"/>further proof hereof take theſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Argum</hi> The ſharpeſt of outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not inconſiſtent with the peculiar love of God, as the ſweeteſt of outward mercies are not the Arguments of that love. Chriſt tells his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>His Kingdom is not of this world:</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the Kingdom of his power and Providence, and this certainly is both in and of this world, and the Kingdom of his grace and goodneſs, and this indeed is not of this world: The Laws of this Kingdom are ſpiritual, the priviledges, the homage, the comforts, the all of this Kingdom is ſpiritual; as concerning all temporals, <hi>love &amp; hatred are not known by all that is before us,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.2. God hath higher and greater things whereby to ſhew his favour and anger than all theſe outward things are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Argum.</hi> The foreſt of outward afflictions are ſo far from being inconſiſtent with peculiar love, that they are many times the expreſſions and evidences of that love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. There is a deſign of mercy to them in all their ſeeming miſeries. Conſider thoſe two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10 <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. the very beſt of Gods people make afflictions neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their good, and therefore God will not ſo far neglect them as not to chaſtiſe them. A tender Parent that beholds his Child running on in extravagancies, the more he loves him, the more ſevere he is in correcting him, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe he hath no patience to ſee his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46197:142"/>Child ruin'd: as for others God lets them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in their ſins, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. he will not be at the pains of correcting them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. but the particular deſignes that God hath in correcting his people are almoſt innumerable, take onely theſe few in ſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes it is to cure their ſpiritual ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, afflictions are Gods Phyſick to purge, his furnace to refine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes to wean them from the world. God imbitters theſe Creature comforts, as the Nurſe rubs the breaſt with wormwood and by that means weans the Child. The world never doth ſeem a more vain and empty thing than in a time of affliction: we are apt to make it our Idol, but we then find it like <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable comforter, a Phyſitian of no value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes to exerciſe their graces; <hi>Jobs</hi> patience had never been ſo eminent, had it not been ſo notably tried. God does therefore reduce his people to great ſtreights, that their trials may be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to thoſe graces himſelf hath wrought in them, their faith, their patience, their hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometimes to encreaſe their experiences, and that in two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning their own weakneſs. Times of affliction are ſifting ſeaſons. God then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers us to our ſelves: the skill of a Pilot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a ſtorm, the valour of a Souldier in a Battle, the ſtrength or weakneſs of a Chriſtian in a time of affliction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning Gods goodneſs; never doth God more fully manifeſt the bowels of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46197:142"/>than in a time of perſecution, when ordinary Providences were not ſufficient for the people of Iſrael, God provided for them by Miracles ſometimes to prepare them for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The infinitely wiſe God who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeveral men to ſeveral ſervices hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral moulds to fit and ſhape them for thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. <hi>Joſeph, Moſes, David</hi> thoſe eminent ine ſtruments all trained up in afflictions. Some there are whom God intends only as privat, paſſengers, others whom he intends as Pilots and theſe latter muſt be well acquainted with winds and Seas, rocks and ſands; all the Books of Navigation can never make a skilful Mariner, there muſt be experience, ſo here.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sometimes to prepare them for mercies, 'tis our miſery we ſeldom know how to prize mercies, but when we want them. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God the more continued it is, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is in it ſelf, but the leſs it ſeems to us, and therefore God makes ſome pauſes, ſome intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his favours, that his mercies may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by recover their due eſteem with us, and that we may the better manage them: and thus doth God by wants fit his people for abundance; by ſtreits for enlargements, by troubles for quietneſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Sometimes to ſharpen their deſires after Heaven: we are in this world but as Pilgrims and Travellers, God permits us to meet with hardſhips in our journey to mind us of our home, that our troubles here may ſtir up our longing after <hi>that reſt which remains for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God hereafter,</hi> Heb 4.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Take heed of entertaining ſo much as one jealous thought concerning the goodneſs,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46197:143"/>faithfulneſs, and tenderneſs of God towards you upon this account, becauſe he afflicts you, 'tis hereby he diſcovers his care of thoſe whoſe welfare he is pleaſed to concern himſelf moſt in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>That 'tis the great advantage of all ſincere Believers, that in all their afflictions they have an intereſt in the Lord as their God.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> here could call nothing in the world his, <hi>he could call the Lord his:</hi> this was his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in that ſore diſtreſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What was this advantage that <hi>David</hi> then had, and all ſincere Believers ſtill have in God as their God, above what others have: in anſwer to which,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an intereſt which all men have in God, as he is their Creator and Preſerver.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is an intereſt which ſome have in God as theirs, by vertue of their living under the tenderneſs of Grace, and their acceptance of theſe tenders, at leaſt in their outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: the obſtinate Jews are ſtyled <hi>Christs own,</hi> John 1.11. and Chriſt and all his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges theirs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is an Intereſt Believers have in the Lord their God above theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Covenant-intereſt, an intereſt in the Lord not only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Sovereignty, but by reaſon of their ſubmiſſion; not only becauſe called and invited by God, but becauſe come over to him; God hath choſen them, and they have choſen him; and theſe are the people that are eſpecially the objects of his love, his delight, his care, his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar treaſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. all that are ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Covenant with God may claim a higher
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46197:143"/>intereſt in God as theirs, than others can, for this is the very language of the Covenant of Grace in the ſeveral periods of its promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he will in an eſpecial manner become their God: <hi>Thus to Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7, 8. <hi>to the people of Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 5.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. to the Jews in their Captivity.</hi> Jer. 24, 7. <hi>to Believers under the Goſpel,</hi> Heb. 8.10. <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 How much there is of advantage to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from this Covenant-intereſt in the Lord as their God, it is a priviledge indeed, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all that either words can expreſs, or thoughts can reach: to have this intereſt in the Lord as our God, includes ſo very much in it, that we cannot rationally deſire more. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16.5, 6. and <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 344.15. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 8. to have him for ours who is the moſt high God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20, 22. the ſupreme good, the only good, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.19. the fountain of all good; all the excellencies that are in the Creatures are in him eminently, yea, infinitely; all created perfections compared to his, are but as a drop to the vaſt Ocean, as a few ſcattered rayes of light to the glorious body of the Sun. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.25. It was the pride of <hi>Pompey</hi> he could endure no ſuperior, and of <hi>Caeſar</hi> he could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no equal; but it is the prerogative of the great God, he hath none above him, or like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Now that this God ſhould ſo fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the God of all ſincere Believers, as the pregnancie of the expreſſion imports, may juſtly be matter of aſtoniſhment. 'Tis no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God promiſes to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Gen. 15. to be a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46197:144"/>Sun and ſhield; to believers under the Goſpel to be a friend and a Father, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.16. But when he promiſes to be a God, this ſurmounts all. Conſider the largeneſs and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of this promiſe: For if he be a God to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whatever he is as God is ours, <hi>i. e.</hi> to our ſupport and comfort. Now who can declare what God is; we ſpeak of him in ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes; there is not one of all theſe Divine excellencies, but is much for the relief of all thoſe that can call him their God, <hi>i. e.</hi> their God in Covenant: as for inſtance.</p>
            <p>This wiſdom is theirs for their direction and counſel: and certainly infinite wiſdom can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be over-reached or defrauded. Known unto him are all things from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>This power is theirs to protect them and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them: and certainly Omnipotence can can never be reſiſted or retarded: if his hand be lifted up, whether in a way of judgment of mercy, who can turn it back. Can any thing be difficult to that God, who by a word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande the whole frame of Nature out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; he that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the Red Sea; Commanded water out of flinty Rocks; rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Manna down from Heaven; ſtopped the mouths of Lions; what can be thought hard for ſuch a God to do?</p>
            <p>His compaſſion is theirs to pity them, and act for them, and ſurely all the tendereſt compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can be found on earth are infinitely ſhort of thoſe bowels of mercy which are in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46197:144"/>God, as <hi>a Father yea more than a mother doth th lord pity thoſe that fear him</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis faithfulneſs is theirs, both to own them here, and recompence them for ever. This is <hi>his Premiſe,</hi> Jer. 32.40.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not only what he is in his Eſſence, but whatever he is in his Subſiſtence is theirs, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their Father, his Son their head, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing all his Offices towards them in pleading for them with God, and pleading from God with them: his Spirit is theirs to convince them, convert them, to purge them, to improve them, to quicken them, to witneſs for them, to ſupply them both with grace and comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever he hath is theirs, his Creatures to ſerve them, his Angels to guard them, his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to adorn them, his Ordinances to improve them, his comforts to ſupport them, his glory to crown them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Whatſoever he doth in the world is theirs, <hi>i. e.</hi> for their good: the Providences of God are various, his ways a great deep, yet though clouds and darkneſs are round about him, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and judgment are the habitations of his Throne. Whatever he doth in the world, yet this is undoubted, he hath an eye at the good of his people in ſome kind or other, though not viſible unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Inform. 1. The aſtoniſhing goodneſs and bounty of God to his Covenant-people, he hath beſtowed himſelf upon them, and what can even infinite bounty beſtow more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. <hi>'Tis ſaid, becauſe there was none greater to ſwear by, he ſwore by himſelf:</hi> ſo here, <hi>becauſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46197:145"/>there was nothing ſo great he could beſtow, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed himſelf.</hi> How infinitely much is there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this? ſo much that we can neither need nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more. Oh what a heighth! a depth! a length! a breadth of love is here ſurpaſſing knowledge! the leſs we are able to underſtand it, the more we ſhould admire it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The dreadful condition of all thoſe who live without God in this world; of all perſons theſe are the worſt provided for againſt dangers, or with comforts, whatever their condition may be in reſpect of earthly confluencies, yet have we cauſe to pity them and pray for them: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but</p>
            <p n="1">1. The meanneſs of thoſe mereies they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; they are but husks that God ſometimes beſtows in anger, and denies in favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The mixture that is in their mercies, there is a curſe mingled with their bleſſings, their table is a ſnare, their enjoyments a trap and a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The momentanineſs of their enjoyments; 'tis but a little while and all ſuch comforts have an end.</p>

            <p n="1">1. What are your thoughts of Go? is he ſo high in your thoughts, that all things elſe are low! can you ſay in ſincerity of heart with <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none on earth I deſire in compariſon of

            <p n="1">1. His ſelf denial: this is the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we have in Scripture.

            <p>The miſery he underwent ſuch as no meet Creature was able to have undergone; his whole life was a life of ſelf denial, his entrance into the world, his continuance in it, and his paſſage out of it, all of them high acts of ſelf-denial.</p>
            <p>The perſons for whom he denied himſelf were ſuch as could not deſerve that kindneſs, no nor deſire it, that could not requite it, but in whom was every thing that might have hindered it; and yet this perſon that denied himſelf was one that ſtood upon even ground with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Phil.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The life of Chriſt was a pure undefiled

            <p>In that under the ſoreſt of afflictions he never diſcovered the leaſt of impatience; his Name was reproached, his perſon contemned, his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul grieved, yet did he not expreſs ſo much as one hard thought of God.</p>

            <p n="1">1. By examining the very foundation and ground-work of all your claims; an errour in the foundation hazards the whole ſtructure, be ſure therefore you begin not at the wrong end; a miſtake in a Principle occaſions a thouſand: if you ſet out in a wrong path, the farther you go, the more you wander, begin therefore here; am I in the number of thoſe who can warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly look up to the Lord as their God; multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes there are who call God Father, and yet are of their father the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8.41, 42, 44. and many again there are who through the weakneſs of their faith, are too ſhie in making thoſe claims to this priviledge which they may of right: many are haſty in catching at the comforts of the promiſes, before they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern in themſelves the diſpoſitions to which theſe promiſes are made; begin therefore with all warineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Improve your intereſt in God by frequent reviews of thoſe rich treaſures you have in him, when once you can reſolve this grand Quaere, that God is yours. In what affectionate eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46197:152"/>and heavenly raptures do we find the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>David</hi> upon theſe reviews, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.28. <hi>Thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee, thou art my God and I will exalt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the neceſſities in the world cannot make him poor who hath ſuch a God for his portion. There are ſeveral ſorts of riches mentioned in Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.21. <hi>James</hi> 2.5. but of all kind of riches, this is the moſt deſirable. Of our ſelves we are poor neceſſitous Creatures, made up of wants, empty Ciſterns, but he is a full fountain: our wants of all kinds are far greater than we are able to expreſs, but we can none of us want ſo much as he is able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>All the calamities in the world cannot make him miſerable who hath God for his happineſs: the primitive Chriſtians did chearfully bear their baniſhments becauſe they could not be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from God, and priſons which ſhut out friends, becauſe they could not ſhut out the Lord. God alone is the happineſs of Heaven, and he that improves his intereſt in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Heaven in his Soul here on earth.</p>
            <p>All the dangers and ſtorms that threaten ſuch, can put them into no hazard, becauſe God is the great diſpoſer of all things, their times are in his hands; and this God, their God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Stand upon your guard againſt all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thoughts, till you have firſt examined the ground of them; thus did <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. reaſon the caſe with himſelf: <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul, why art thou troubled within me?</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:46197:153"/>he would not let his troubled thoughts paſs, till he had firſt examined them, and called them to an account. Did Chriſtians ſtand thus upon their watch, they would not be ſo often ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with diſpondances.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Suppreſs all jealouſies about God. Hath God ſhewn you, and doth he ſtill ſhew you great and fore troubles; if you can truly call God yours, Queſtion not, he deals with you no otherwiſe than with Sons, and in the ſharpeſt Providences hath no other deſign upon you, than your good, and the very worſt he means you is your profit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be ſerious and frequent in meditation. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is the life of Religion. Meditate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Meditate upon the reſerves of mercy God hath for his people hereafter; are you now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that Communion you formerly have had with Chriſtian friends, think of what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

            <p n="3">3. Meditate upon the tendencie of all your afflictions to thoſe bleſſed ends for which God deſigns them; look not upon your afflictions as to their preſent aſpect, that may be grim and gaſtly, but as to their effects and fruits, and they are higly encouraging, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Meditate upon the ſmalneſs of thoſe evils you undergo, and the greatneſs of thoſe evils you are freed from; you may not perhaps be freed from loſſes, reproaches, pains, weakneſſes, but if you belong to God, you are freed from ſin, from wrath, from hell.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

He meditates on time, to the end he might the better improve it; and this in many verſes. He meditates upon Eternity that he might be the better provided for it, and as the ſubjects of his meditations were ſolemn, ſo his management of them was ſerious; for you finde in the 2, 3, and <hi>4th</hi> verſes, when he was ſo overwhelmed with ſorrow that he was unable to ſpeak to men by way of converſe, yet he ſpeaks to God by way of Prayer, and to his own Soul by way of counſel and advice: and truly thoſe Profeſſors that are not ſerious in theſe weighty matters can be no better than luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm.

            <p>In opening this Obſervation theſe three things are to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Grace is our ſpiritual ſtrength, and that which will hearten and encourage our Souls in their going hence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this ſpiritual ſtrength is ſubject to decays, and may be much empaired: <hi>That I may recover ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is nothing renders the life of Nature deſirable in compariſon of his, that we may recover our decays in Grace, that we may obtain an improvement in holineſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Grace is our ſpiritual ſtrength; Grace is not only given us for an Ornament, but for ſervice; God doth not beſtow it upon us only as our duty, but as our ſtrength: thus we often find it called in Scripture, the ſtrength of the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.7. <hi>They ſhall every one of them go from ſtrength to ſtrenth:</hi> that is the ſame which in other places is called <hi>from graceto grace, and from faith to faith;</hi> that is from a leſs degree to a higher. I might inſtance in the Church of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia Thou haſt a little ſtrength,</hi> Rev. 3.8. that is, there is the reality of Grace, but it is Grace as it was in its infancie; thou haſt but a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46197:163"/>little ſtrength: Indeed where ever there is Grace, there is a proportionableneſs of ſtrength. Inlightening Graces are the ſtrength of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; a Soul that is ſpiritually anointed, acts ſtrongly in its apprehenſive faculty; ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying Graces are the ſtrength of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſanctifying Graces are the ſtrength of the whole inward man.</p>
            <p>But more particularly, there is a three fold ſtrength in Grace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a ſtrength of intereſt as it intitles us to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Strength of improvement as Grace grows up to a higher ſtature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſtrength of evidence.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is a ſtrength of intereſt by Grace, by which we can claim an intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that is great ſtrength to our Souls when we are going hence and ſhall be no more. If you can ſay Chriſt is yours, then all is yours: life is yours and death is yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt, All things are yours.</hi> If once God hath given us his Son, he will with him give us all things: and he that hath given us this Grace will with hold no good thing from us. God will think nothing too much for them upon whom he hath beſtowed his Son; and who are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have an intereſt in Chriſt? <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh but have everlaſting life:</hi> that believeth on him, there is the Grace of faith. There is a time coming when we ſhall ſay to riches and to relations and all Creature-enjoyments, there
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46197:163"/>was a time when you were uſeful, refreſhing, and comfortable, but your time is now paſt; it is not in you to comfort us, to ſet open the door of Heaven for us; it is not for you to appear before God on our behalves; it is not in you to deliver us from the evils we now fear, nor to confer upon us the good things which are to be deſired. Nothing can hide the Soul from the diſpleaſure of God, nothing can procure it thoſe undeſerved favours, and make it compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy but only Chriſt; but if we have Chriſt, we have all with him: here is the ſtrength of intereſt, when the Soul is in want, and to leave all its enjoyments in the world at once (as friends, eſtate, relations) yet if the Soul hath an intereſt in Chriſt, death doth not ſeparate it from Chriſt; that you have <hi>Rom</hi> 8. <hi>laſt. Nor heighth nor depth, nor life nor death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe is the ſtrength of improvement: for though weak faith, and weak Grace may hold its own, in God and Chriſt; yet this hold is not ſo firm and faſt as when Grace is grown up to ſome ſtature and hath attained ſome degree of ſtrength. It is a notable paſſage of a Learned Writer, <hi>They do but make a great noiſe in the world about Grace and Chriſt, that make no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Grace, and are not every day making ſome farther prgreſs in their ſpiritual intereſt.</hi> 'Tis true, where-ever there is the leaſt degree of grace there is the myſtical union to Jeſus Chriſt, and a communion with Chriſt in his Graces, for light and heat always come and go together; for when Chriſt comes into the Soul, he brings along with him theſe bleſſings. But yet though
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46197:164"/>no Chriſtian can be any farther in poſſeſſion of Chriſt, than he doth make uſe of him, yet there are ſeveral degrees of ſtrength, which by out making uſe of Chriſt we may attain unto. To inſtance in mortification of ſins, and the ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our corruptions. A Soul that can appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Chriſt will be deriving Conqueſt from Chriſt over its inbred corruptions, and power to get Authority over its continued temptations, ſuch a Soul will be crucified to the world, and all the luſts of the fleſh; and ſo as to vivification and newneſs of life; a Soul that can challenge a propriety in Chriſt will fetch dower not only from his death for the mortification of ſin, but alſo from his Reſurrection; for holineſs and newneſs of life and converſation, it will finde living deſires and longings and lively ſtirrings of heart after God continually.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the ſtrength of evidence or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which reſults from Grace. <hi>That I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover may ſtrength</hi> When the Soul by reflecting upon it ſelf, nnds that it hath made ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement by the means of Grace and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities it doth enjoy, and that really it hath got an intereſt in Chriſt, and ſees ſome Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds to reckon it ſelf among thoſe beloved ones, whoſe names are written in the Book of life; this will fill the Soul with joy here, and bear it up under all preſſures and difficulties it may meet with in its paſſage, this will animate it to look death in the face, and that with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Now theſe three ſorts of ſtrength are ſo admirably advantageous, will appear from the language of departing Souls when they come
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46197:164"/>to lie upon their death-beds; what is it that makes the poor Soul that is ready to take its flight into another world, when it is juſt going hence and ſhall be no more, to quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the want of ſome of theſe ſtrengths? O ſays one, If I had but an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, I could ſay with <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luke 2.20. <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy ſervant depart:</hi> Death ſhould not then ſtorm me; no, I would then make a quick and ſpeedy ſurrender of my ſelf to it, then it ſhould not lay ſiege to me: Says a ſecond, had I more ſtrength of improvement, had I walked more circumſpectly, lived more ſelf-denyingly, had I approved my ſelf more faithful in all my Relations, I ſhould then have been more able with the dying Swan to have ſung my ſelf aſleep in my laſt bed, as the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralliſt ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Says a third, had I an evidence and an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my relation to Chriſt; did I certainly know I have an intereſt in the love of God, then I ſhould welcome death, and ſay welcome thou Prince of terrours, for though thy face be grim, yet thy meſſage is comfortable, ſo that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual ſtrength, that will beſtead the Soul at ſuch a time: and whatever mercy we may be found wanting of, what a mercy will it be to us not to be found wanting of this mercy, this ſpiritual ſtrength. It is no great matter in what way death comes to us, if it find us with this ſpiritual ſtrength, in reference to our eterual condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Part.</hi> This ſpiritual ſtrength is ſubject to many failings and decays.</p>
            <pb n="272" facs="tcp:46197:165"/>
            <p>Our ſtrength as to intereſt ('tis true) can not be loſt, for a Soul that is once united to Chriſt is never ſeparated from him again. <hi>My Father</hi> (faith our Saviour) <hi>is greater than all, and none can pluck them out of my Fathers hands.</hi> The very innitiative Covenant by which Chriſt eſpouſeth a Soul to himſelf, carries the longeſt date along with it; <hi>I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee:</hi> thou art mine, and ſhalt be mine: I do love thee, and I will love thee for ever, <hi>John</hi> 13.3. <hi>He loved his own to the end, he gives grace, and he will give glory.</hi> But though it is true that cannot be loſt, yet the ſtrength and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the evidence of this intereſt may be blotted and darkned, it may be intermitted and interrupted; our ſpiritual comforts may be clouded by inbred corruptions breaking in upon the Soul: Godmay ſuffer the Soul to be foyled and born down for a time; this you ſhall find in the moſt chearful and the moſt improved Chriſtians, and thoſe that have had ſometimes the cleareſt diſcoveries of Gods love to their Souls; what a damp hath ſometimes been upon their Joys? inſomuch that <hi>David</hi> was fain to call himſelf to an account, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul?</hi> How have even he beſt of Saints many times thought themſelves meer caſt-aways, and ſuch as whom God had forſaken utterly. Indeed to diſcouſe how far a Child of God may go backwards in his Comforts, is a task too large to ſpeak to; but queſtionleſs there may be a great decay in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength, in the ſtrength of improvement; Grace may feem to be quite withered and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46197:165"/>up: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had <hi>loſt her firſt love,</hi> her flouriſhing, her vigorous love. The Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> ſeemed to be quite dead, at leaſt ready to die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt a name to live, but art dead,</hi> as to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. We ſay a reai Chriſtian can never be under ſuch a deprivation of all kind of ſpiritual life and ſenſe, he may be ſo as to others; he may have no ſymptoms of ſpiritual life left, yet there may be ſome ſtruglings for life remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>And as for Aſſurance they may be bronght ſo low as to be upon the very brink of deſpair, yet they can neither fall totally, nor finally: how ſhould this make us to walk humbly, for if once we begin to be tickled with ſpiritual pride, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any ſpiritual improvement, becauſe we outſtrip others, God can quickly ſuffer us to fall into the common level whith the meaneſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p>As Grace is our ſpiritual ſtrength, and this is ſubject to decays and declinations: ſo third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the great thing that ſuch as rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand themſelves that renders the life of nature deſirable to them, it is in order ot their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this ſpiritual ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O ſpare me:</hi> Why? <hi>that I may recover ſtrength.</hi> He doth notſay, that I may obtain riches and worldly greatneſs, and compaſs great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for my ſelf in theſe outward things, but that I may recover my ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The life of nature is in it ſelf the higheſt of outward mercies (for all other mercies are but as ſo many Cyphers without is) if it were not
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46197:166"/>for liſe, we were not capable of enjoying them: hence it is as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>A living Dog is better than a dead Lyon:</hi> when Death comes, it puts us in an utter incapacity of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any refreſhment from theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts; therefore it is the Devil ſaid to <hi>Job, Skin for skin and all that a man hath will be give for his life.</hi> It was a truth though from the father of lyes; now though it be in it ſelf a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirable thing, yet that which makes it more deſirable is in order to this ſpiritual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How ſad muſt needs be the condition of ſuch who only live here to the gratifying of their ſenſes: the longer we live, the more we ſhall encreaſe our ſcore, and the more guilty we ſhall make our ſelves. Certainly we are to live to better purpoſe. Nor can we be ſaid more truly to live then when our Souls do moſt thrive and flouriſh in Grace. The Heathens themſelves thought that meerly to breath, to eat and drink, and converſe with men, and to have a being in this world as men, was not worthy the name of living; and therefore they made a diſtinction between being and living; and others have been ſaid to be in the world, and to paſs a little time in the world, but not to live: not to live well, is a kind of dying, a life below the life of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Applic.</hi> Then what cauſe have we to be thankful-you ſee Grace is our ſtrength; it is that by which we lay hold on Chriſt, and God who is our ſtrength; and it is our improvement in Grace that makes our evidences more clear and apparent: then if this be the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46197:166"/>to make life deſirable, our improvement in Grace; then remember for what purpoſe you came into this world, God hath not given you lives only that you may live as thoſe Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe they had but a little time to live, therefore they will make as much of it as they can; becauſe they had ſo little a time to live in the world to enjoy the comforts of it, therefore they would take their fill of them. <hi>Come let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die:</hi> ſhould we make this uſe of all Gods forbearance of us, when God hath ſwept away thouſands by the deſtroying peſtilence? and when the arrows of God have flown ſo thick about us? when ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have faln on our right hands and on our left, ſhal we make this the end of the goodnes of God in ſparing us? becauſe more time is given us, therefore we will give our luſts their ſwing? this would be very ſad and a fore evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: though God hath ſpared us, yet if we do ſo, our deliverances are not deliverances but reprivals: it is one thing to be delivered from a calamity, and another thing to be reprieved, to be ſpared for a time that God may puniſh us more ſeverely hereafter: and if we conſider in thoſe deſtroying flames that have laid waſte the habitations of others, that any of ours have been preſerved, ſhall we make no better uſe of it than thus? when God hath under ſo many ſeveral judgments ſhewed that kindneſs to us which he promiſed to <hi>Ebed Melech, Jerem.</hi> 39.18. Notwithſtanding when he had threatned all thoſe miſeries againſt them, <hi>I will ſurely deliver thee, becauſe thou haſt put thy trust in me, ſaith the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46197:167"/>Lord.</hi> God doth not know how to caſt off them that caſt themſelves upon him. Thou haſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thy truſt in me, and I will be faithful to that truſt; I will do it for thee. But our care ſhould be to improve our time to the utmoſt, we have but a little time to be here, <hi>and when we go hence we ſhall be no more.</hi> That is, no more to prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory opportunities, and in this lies our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concerns: conſider the ſadneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who go hence in their ſins; they do at once leave all their comfort, and they exchange comforts for ſorrows: how can theſe perſons go hence in their ſins and look Chriſt in the face with any kind of countenaace? how can they attain to the inheritance of the Saints in light? they can look for nothing for their portion but wrath, eternal wrath: could we but lay our ears to liſten to thoſe Souls that are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning the loſs of their time, thoſe that have enjoyed repenting ſeaſons, and peace-making ſeaſons, but now never ſhall be more; how ſhould we hear them bewailing their folly: it is true, a time was when we might have obtained a pardon, and a peace might have been made for our Souls, we might have obtained the love of God, but we then would not: how often did Chriſt ſpeak to theſe Souls as he did to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, How often would I have gathered thee as a hen her chickens under her wings, but ye would not, but now behold thy houſe is left unto thee deſolate. Oh! that thou hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong unto thy peace:</hi> never to enjoy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity more, ſhould inhance our eſtimation of this rich mercy. That God (though he
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46197:167"/>hath perhaps taken away thy great eſtate, and thy outward comforts) hath ſpared your lives, and lengthened out opportunities of getting our peace made, and recovering our thrength before we go hence and be no more.</p>
            <p>Conſider how often we have deſerved to be cut ſhort of theſe opportunities, and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell for our ſins.</p>
            <p>Then ſtudie the excellencie of time, we ſquander it away not conſidering what a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewel time is; it is a golden ſtream, gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding down from one Eternity to another. Nay, it is ſuch a precious thing, that when once it is gone, all the Gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> cannot call it back again; it is that without w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we can do nothing; and ſhall we do nothing with it while we have it? the very <hi>Heathen</hi> could complain of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their miſpence of time. <hi>Seneca</hi> hath this paſſage, <hi>We are very prodigal of our time,</hi> and there is nothing about which we can be honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covetous but only for the well managing of that. And therefore let us be much in being more ſerious in the buſineſs of our Souls, if God ſpare us time. Let us devote much of our time in community with our ſelves. It was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Augustus the Roman Emperor, That the buſineſſeſs of the Empire were ſo many and took up ſo much of his time, that he could never be at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for himſelf.</hi> Be often at leaſure with your own ſouls to talk with your Conſciences, and ſee how it ſtands between God and you: be careful to obſerve reading ſeaſons, and praying ſeaſons, and meditating upon the word of God.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46197:168"/>Remember we are all going hence and ſhall be no more; and the only thing that we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our continuance for here, is this; for other things <hi>Solomon</hi> pronounceth vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be in them, as if there were more bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them than any real comfort.</p>
            <p>Friends, now is the time of gathering <hi>Manna,</hi> now is the heavenly <hi>Market</hi> wherein ſpiritual commodities muſt be bought before the Market be ended: In the harveſt we gather the fruits of the earth. Now if Mercy be in good earneſt ſought for, it will not be with held, and our la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be loſt.</p>
            <p>And then as we ſhould do this in reſpect of our ſelves, ſo alſo in reſpect of others; let us be doing as much good as we can in our places by reproving others ſins, by our holy lives, and contrary converſations, and by doing what we can on their behalſs by our prayers. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows out time upon us as Talents, and is it not fit our time ſhould be laid out for the ſervice of our Maſter? If we can be laborious in working while it is day, this will make our ſleep comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us when the great night of death comes: and if we labour now in the Lord, be ſure we ſhall die in the Lord; and, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their works follow them.</hi>

            <p>THis Chapter, and indeed this whole Epiſtle, conſiſts of nothing almoſt but directions to <hi>Timothy</hi> how he ſhould carry himſelf in the diſcharge of that great Office of an Evangeliſt; there are ſeveral things the Apoſtle ſpeaks by way of counſel, and ſeveral things by way of caution.</p>
            <p>There are two things eſpecially which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives advice to <hi>Timothy</hi> in, and it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that whatever advice he giveth him as an Evangeliſt, who was to preach the Goſpel, he gives us who profeſs ſubjection to the Goſpel: they were the truths he chargeth him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint others with, and therefore they are truths that we are eſpecially obliged to take notice of, as being of concernment to us.</p>
            <p>Here are two things that he would have <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> careful to warn others of:</p>
            <p>The one is, of ſuch kind of Profeſſors, <hi>Who as concerning the Faith had erred.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:46197:169"/>
            <p>The other is, of ſuch, who (though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Doctrinal part of faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> read in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, who erred concerning the faith:</hi> and their great errour was that they thought the Reſurrection was already paſt, and by this means <hi>overthrew the faith of ſome;</hi> they thought there was no other Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but that from a ſtate of ſin, to a ſtate of Grace: but now, ſay he, though this be their miſtake, and a dangerous error, yet the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> their inſection is of a ſpreading nature, <hi>it eats as doth a canker:</hi> but yet ſays he, let not this ſtartle others; for though theſe errors, theſe fundamental errors take away the thoughts of the Reſurrection and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and deſtroy the foundation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as the Learned <hi>Morella</hi> obſerves) take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the thoughts of immortal Souls, and an eternal eſtate, and then farewel all ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the World: <hi>yet the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> ver. 19. it is as much as if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoke, as he doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>Though the number of Iſrael were as the ſand upon the Sea ſhore, yet but a ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be ſaved; yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Election have obtained: what if ſome fell off, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, yet the Election of God ſtands faſt.</hi> It is compared here to a foundation, the firmeſt part of the building, and that upon which the whole ſuperſtructure ſtands; and it is ſaid to ſtand ſure, becauſe it <hi>hath this Seal, the Lord knoweth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46197:169"/>who are his:</hi> The Lord out of mercy takes a fatherly care of them, and commits them to the charge of his Son: <hi>My Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is greater than all, and none can pluck his ſheep out of his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is another ſort of errors, and that is in point of practice (as a Learned Writer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) <hi>There are heretical Manners as well as Doctrines;</hi> and men may be heretical in their lives, as well as in their Opinions: to theſe the Apoſtle gives advice here in the Text, that he ſhould charge <hi>every one that names the Name of Christ to depart from iniquity.</hi> How many are there that reſt ſatisfied with a <hi>form of Godlineſs, but deny the power of it;</hi> theſe are the perſons whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Timothy</hi> advice here, that he ſhould labour to redeem from thoſe formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in which they reſted, that they ſhould not think it enough to name the Name of Chriſt, but they ſhould expreſs their ſincerity therein by departing from iniquity.</p>
            <p>In the words you have theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The perſons to whom this advice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that is, to ſuch as name the Name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhew you how it is uſed (briefly) in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>There is a naming of the Name of Chriſt by profeſſion; they that own the Truths and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion; they that profeſs the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which our Saviour hath revealed in the Goſpel: <hi>Micha</hi> 4.5. it is ſpoken there of two ſorts of perſons, of thoſe that worſhip falſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46197:170"/>gods, and of thoſe that worſhip the true God; <hi>For all the people, every one will walk in the Name of his God,</hi> that is, they own thoſe Rules, and acknowledge thoſe Principles: <hi>and we will walk in the Name of the Lord our God for ever</hi> This is a naming of Chriſt by way of profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a naming of Chriſt in all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion: as in our Prayers, <hi>Whatever you ask in my Name of the Father, he will give it:</hi> in our duties all muſt be offered up in his Name: <hi>God hath given him a Name above every Name, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things in heaven and earth, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow;</hi> that is, in prayer. Now in the former ſenſe, the naming the Name of Chriſt by profeſſion is to be taken in oppoſition to Heathens, who name the Name of other gods: <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that know thee not, and upon the families that call not upon thy Name,</hi> Pſal. 79.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a naming the Name of Chriſt in our Vows and Covenants; and thus in our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm we vow to become his; and hence it is, that we are ſaid <hi>to baptized in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> which doth not only imply a deſire to partake of thoſe priviledges which Chriſt hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but an obligation which we lay upon our ſelves to own him as our Lord, and to ſubmit to all his Commands, and to be guided by his Will and Laws, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. <hi>They were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a naming the Name of Chriſt in our expectations and hopes, when we build all our confidence upon him alone. <hi>The deſires of our Souls are to thee, and to the Remembrance of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46197:170"/>thy Name.</hi> We look for no other mercy but what the Lord gives, and no other help but what he vouchſafes: theſe are the perſons to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this advice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the advice and counſel it ſelf, Let all ſuch perſons depart from iniquity: the Word in the Greek is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, let him be an Apoſtate from ſin, and Satan. When <hi>Luther</hi> was challenged by the Jeſuites for being an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, becauſe he had renounced his old Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (ſays he) I confeſs I am, but it is from the Devil. Such an Apoſtacie is no reproach to a perſon; nay, ſuch is of abſolute neceſſity; for we are all by nature ſervants to ſin and in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Satan. Now, <hi>let him depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> depart from the practice of it, and from the love of it, and as much as he can from any inclination to it: you can never reconcile the profeſſion of Chriſt, and the practice of ſin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that is the meaning of the Apoſtle, doeſt thou name the Name of Chriſt, and go on in ſin? Your lives are a contradiction to your profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Let every one that names, &amp;c. depart from iniquity.</hi> But then obſerve the extent here, <hi>let every one,</hi> not only thoſe that ſo name the Name of Chriſt, as having the Doctrine of Chriſt committed eſpecially to them to communicate to other; (thus we read of naming the Name of Chriſt, <hi>they taught in his Name</hi>) but it is meant of all that profeſs the Name of Chriſt, let every one in any way, though he be but in a way of outward profeſſion only, let him make it his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to depart from inquity.</p>
            <pb n="284" facs="tcp:46197:171"/>
            <p>The Obſervation is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>There are special obligations upon all to depart from iniquity, who name the Name of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpak to theſe two heads in opening the Doctrinal part.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That here are great ingagements upon all men to depart from iniquity; this I ſhall prove from theſe Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt may from the nature of ſin; what is ſin but our diſeaſe, our burden, and that which endangers our utter ruine: ſhould men be in love with poyſon? Should men hug that viper that will ſting them to death? the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin doth ſufficiently evidence this: now what is ſin? It is a tranſgreſſion of Gods Law; it is a trampling upon Gods Authority, it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing him to rule over us, it is a making God our enemy, it is a daring of him in the open field: Do you provoke the Lord to anger? are you ſtronger than he? dare you enter the liſts with the great God? you will pity thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted perſons that labour for their own ruine, and would haſten their own death by ſome kind of violence or other, this is the practice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of God that obligation that lies upon all ſorts of perſons to have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and high thoughts of God then to ſlight his Laws; we are all his Creatures, we owe our very beings to him; it is God that made us, we are his Creatures, and the workmanſhip of his hands; God may very well expect thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which he hath given us, ſhould be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46197:171"/>for him. Shall a man plant a Vineyard and not eat of the fruit thereof? If God hath made us men, and beſtowed natural endowments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and hath put us into a capacity for his ſervice may not God reaſonably expect that he ſhould receive the fruit of all his charges and pains? upon his account it was that God was ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </gap> he had ſhewed to them (ſays he) <hi>When I looked for grapes behold they brought forth with grapes:</hi> I have made you capable of my ſervice, will you imploy your ſelves in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of other Maſters? your beings you have received from me, is it not reaſonable they ſhould be imployed to his Glory, ſince they have been received from his bounty?</p>
            <p>Again, in reſpect of Gods continuance and preſervation of our beings, this is from him. Alas! ſhould not God ſupport us every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhould ſink into our firſt nothing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by things by the Word of his power,</hi> it was God that firſt breathed life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and it is God that keeps our breath in our noſtrils, we ſhould otherwiſe every moment be breathing out our laſt: have we received our beings from him, and do we ſtill live upon him? then there is all the obligation upon us that can be, that we ſhould have reverend thoughts of God, and not deſpiſe nor contemn him, nor prefer other things above him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, all our ſupplies are from God, it is God that furniſheth us with all our comforts that we enjoy: thoſe refreſhments that others want, and with thoſe mercies that others are
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46197:172"/>denied, all this is from the goodneſs of God; and conſider how it fares with others, and how much better it is with you than it is with them that are your betters, and certainly there is very great reaſon upon this account that we ſhould not thus ſlight him, but depart from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is offenſive to him.</p>
            <p>Nay, conſider not only all our ſupplies for the preſent, but all our hopes for the future are this God. Haſt thou any hopes of Heaven and happineſs in another world? haſt thou any right to, or any hopes of eternal bleſſedneſs? all is built upon the goodneſs of God, in and through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Nay, all our hopes of ſpiritual mercies even in this world are in God: Do you now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of hardneſs of heart, of Soul diſtempers? it is only God that can be your Phyſitian. Alas! means are nothing, and inſtruments are nothing, unleſs God owns them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the welfare of our own Souls; there is nothing but iniquity can make us hateful in the ſight of God. Our afflflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and outward miſeries cannot: theſe may be many times the effects of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but never the cauſe of his diſpleaſure; there is nothing can render us hateful to God but only ſin: God is angry with nothing but ſin: now if we would eſcape the wrath of God, we muſt keep our ſelves from all ſin, we muſt depart from iniquity, <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 18.27, 30. if you will go on in ſin, if you will not depart from iniquity, there is nothing to be expected but death, hell, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46197:172"/>wrath. You can never look that God ſhould be a friend to you, while you continue an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to him; you can never expect that he ſhould be reconciled to you on his part, whilſt you will not be reconciled to him on your part; if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will have their will againſt God, God will have his will upon them. There is no other way to be free from this curſe in all conditions, but by departing from iniquity; for we make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition a curſe when we mix iniquity with it; our comforts then are ſtumbling-blocks, our enjoyments then are ſnares and temptations whilſt we have a ſinful nature; but they highly encreaſe our guilt, when we abuſe theſe by ſin, and unleſs we depart from iniquity all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we enjoy, outward mercies, and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mercies are overſpread with a curſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are ſpecial engagements that lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that name the Name of Chriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that name the name of Chriſt only in profeſſion &amp; appearance, muſt not take the name of Chriſt in vain; God hath expreſly ſaid, <hi>He will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain.</hi> Now this is a taking the Name of God and Chriſt in vain, in allowing our ſelves in any kind of iniquity; this is clear from the Prayer of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur, Pro.</hi> 30.9. he prays there againſt extremity in both conditions, he would neither have too much nor too little of this world, he prays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fulneſs, <hi>Leſt I be full &amp; deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord; or leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the Name of my God in vain;</hi> that is, leſt I take any irregular courſes for the ſupplies of my
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46197:173"/>neceſſity, leſt I take they Name in vain. While we allow our ſelves in any kind of ſin, we do but take the Name of God in vain, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our profeſſion; but this is not all: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. you read of an highter expreſſion than this; <hi>For your ſakes,</hi> or, <hi>by your means,</hi> or, reaſon of your practice <hi>the Name of God is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed among the Gentiles through you: for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion verily profiteth if thou keep the Law, but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumciſion is made uncircumciſion.</hi> Here the engagements laid upon them that profeſs Gods Name, becauſe he hath given them ſo much knowledge to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the great Myſteries of Salvation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with thoſe Principles that are of abſolute neceſſity to underſtand their own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rnal good, and for them to break thoſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is but to take Gods Name in vain; nay, it is to blaſpheme his Name amongſt them that are ſtrangers to him.</p>
            <p>But for them that name the Name of Chriſt in ſincerity, there are ſpecial obligations God hath laid upon them, there are ſingular engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God upon them, and obligations from them unto God that oblige them to depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſingular engagements that God hath laid upon them to depart from iniquity, as</p>
            <p>Firſt, not only vouchſafeing them the means of Grace, but in Accompanying thoſe means with the efficacious concurrence of his Spirit. How many parts of the world live without any knowledge of the true God at all? it is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46197:173"/>therefore to enjoy the means of knowledge, yea, it is a great mercy that the Pſalmiſt highly values, <hi>Thou haſt not dealt ſo with every Natin, as for his Judgments they have not known them,</hi> Pſal. 147.20. and how many thouſands are there that live under the Goſpel, to whom it is no more than a dead Letter; they hear the noiſe, or ſound of the Goſpel, but it makes little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon their hearts. Now on all thoſe that do profeſs the Name of Chriſt, there is a ſpecial obligation upon them, becauſe of the great things that God hath done for them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Chriſt hath done for thee; hath Chriſt broken off the yoke of Satan? and wilt thou put it on again? hath he taken off thy burdens, and cured the Diſeaſes? and art thou fond of thy burdens and in love with thy Diſeaſes? hath he ſt thee at liberty, hath his Spirit made thee free? (and ſuch are free indeed) and wilt thou again become entangled?</p>
            <p>Again, hath Chriſt waſhed away thy filth by his blood, and wilt thou return again like the Sow that is waſhed to wallow in thy former mire? hath he taken off the guilt of thy ſin? and wilt thon run upon a new ſcore, is this ſutable to the engagements that lie upon thee? Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if thou art one that doth relie upon Chriſt, there lies an high Obligation upon thee on that account: hath he redeemed thy poor captive Soul out of the hands of that grand Uſuper, and Tyrant? and wilt thou become like one of thoſe ſervants that would have his ear bored, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſervant while he lived to his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? this is to deſpiſe the kindueſs of Chriſt,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46197:174"/>is to undervalue the bleſſing of the Goſpel. Hath Chriſt taken thee into his care and ſervice? and wilt thou not be guided by his rules? but what are the rules of Chriſt in reſpect of God? that we ſhould not only ſerve him, but ſerve him form a Principle of love; it is not enough that we bring our bodies to God in every duty, but that we alſo bring our hearts unto him; this is that which our Saviour expects: He tells us, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> John 4.24. <hi>and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth: bodily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice profiteth nothing.</hi> Alas! men maybe much in out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de duties and ſervices, and yet at laſt be rejected with ſcorn to their great grief, unleſs they be ſerious. That heed that what you do, you do not againſt Chriſts Rules, that you do not refuſe his directions and Councels; thoſe that are acquainted with thoſe rules there lies a ſpecial obligation upon them to obſerve them: hath Chriſt taken the care of you himſelf, and will you not live up to this kindneſs? this is not to anſwer your ingagements.</p>
            <p>Again, I might ſhew you the great priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which all the true Members of Chriſt do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, he hath ſent his Spirit to be their guide, his Spirit of Truth to lead them into all Truth; the Spirit to enlighten the Soul, to purge, refine, and ſanctifie the Soul; to excite, aſſiſt, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and preſerve the weak beginnings of Grace; to guide and conduct the Soul into farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; and to witneſs to the comforts of God: and will you contradict theſe Principles of Divine Grace? God hath ſent his Spirit to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46197:174"/>guide you, that is, to keep you from miſtakes, to prevent your miſcarriage, and will you yet go on in iniquity? The great deſign of God in ſending his Son, and of his Son in ſending his Spirit, Was not only to redeem his People from hell and wrath, but from ſin and Satan, <hi>and to make them a peculiar people to himſelf, zealous of good works:</hi> now what ingratitude is this to croſs theſe deſigns of mercy. Alas! God cannot be the better for us. I ſpeak now to ſuch as think that they do in ſincerity name the Name of Chriſt ſo as to depart from iniquity: for be ſure of this, that there is no poſſibility of reconciling two ſuch contrary enemies as Chriſt and ſin; for he came into the world on this very errand to deſtroy the works of the Devil; and this is your work to oppoſe the Devil and ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſpecial obligations that they have laid upon themſelves by their Covenants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: they that do aright name the Name of Chriſt have ſolemnly devoted themſelves to Chriſt not only in their baptiſmal Vows, but in reiterated Covenants; now will you revoke them? is this ſutable to thoſe engagements to break your word with God and to have your own promiſes to witneſs againſt you? you that have owned his yoke as eaſie, and ſubmitted to his ways as deſirable; and made profeſſion of theſe, will you contradict all in your lives and converſations? truly, this is too ordinary in the world: St. <hi>Paul Titus</hi> 1.16. doth very much lament ſome, <hi>who in their words profeſs the Name of Chriſt, but in their works deny him.</hi> Verbal Profeſſions are eaſie; but practical Profeſſions,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46197:175"/>thoſe that God looks for, he is the beſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, not that can talk moſt, but live beſt, and keep himſelf moſt unſpotted from the pollutions of the world; now remember the Vows that you made with God, and conſider the engagements that lie upon you from thence to have a tendder regard of Gods glory: every iniquityis a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, it is a rejecting of God from ruling over us; it is a diſparagement to his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as if we thought we could ſpend our time better than in hi ſervice, as if we could live to better purpoſe than in minding thoſe duties that he requires of us. <hi>David</hi> was of another mind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. laſt. <hi>It is good for me to draw neer to God.</hi> Pſal. 84. <hi>A day in thy Courts is better than a thouſand.</hi> But what a reproach do you caſt upon God and his wayes, in that you ſee and fancie ſomething in ſin that you think worthy the making God you enemy for; though you part with God, and loſe his favour, yet you think there is ſomething in ſin that will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe that loſs: every ſinner doth ſo, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows himſelf in any ſin. Truly, though God is gratious to us in affording us the liberty of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his preſence, yet while we allow our ſelves in any ſin, all our duties are but loſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and to very little purpoſe, and we can expect no other anſwer from God, than we have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes? or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Name in thy mouth?</hi> What was the matter? <hi>Seeing thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my word behind thy back.</hi> While men allow themſelves in any ſin, all their duties are to no purpoſe. Conſider how much
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46197:175"/>more God hath ſhewed of kindneſs to you than others, and conſider how many engagements are upon you beyond what are upon others; certainly form both theſe, God cannot but have higher expectations from you, than any; and will you thus requite the Lord? or will you ſay as the people of Iſrael did when they were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and met with ſtreights and difficulties in the Wilderneſs? <hi>Would to God we had died in Egypt, was there not graves enough there?</hi> So while you live under the temptations and ſnares of an evil world, will you look on on theſe things as lovely, and deſervint to be fond of them? Chriſt came to redeem you from them, and you have accepted of that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you have bound your ſelves by your Oathes and Seals; and how ſad will it be if thoſe Seals do witneſs to your Condemnation, both on Chriſts part, and on your own part? Chriſt will ſay one day, Theſe are the perſons whom I have proffered Salvation to, and they did ſeem to accept of it, and to cloſe wit it; but they have caſt off all, and for ſaken all thoſe deſigns of mercy that I had to their Souls; and what can they now look for but wrath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And ſo I have gone over the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the Obſervation.</p>
            <p>The firſt Uſe may be to awaken and ſtartle Profeſſors, that though they do name the Name of Chriſt, yet there is ſo much of iniquity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, and connived at by them: we can never own Chriſt, till we fall off from ſin and Satan: While we cloſe with a contrary party, we cannot approve our ſelves faithful to him:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46197:176"/>there are but two parties in all the world, Chriſt and the Devil; now ſhall we pretend to Chriſt, and wear his Colours, and take his Livery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and call our ſelves his Subjects, and yet allow our ſelves in the ſervice of ſin and Satan? Let our Profeſſion be never ſo high, yet if we do ſo, this is one word to unſay all, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict all again. This I ſay therefore, may ſharply reprove all careleſs Profeſſors that lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their watch, and do not always ſtand upon their guard to keep off every thing of ſin. You know how much Chriſt hath deſerved from us; ſhall I little minde you in two or three hints.</p>
            <p>Conſider how much he hath done and ſuffered for all that belong to him; he thought no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings too great to leave (even ſuch bleſſings as none but himſelf was ever capable of) for no Creature could be capable of thoſe high and eminent priviledges that he left, that he might become our Redeemer; and as there was no mercy that he thought too great to leave, ſo there was no miſery that he thought too ſharp to undergo, that the wrath of God his Father (whoſe love to him was more worth than milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of worlds) might be appeaſed, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Redemption of poor loſt Creatures, he was willing to bear it, <hi>Lo, I came, in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litinne of thy will; Oh my God; yea, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Thus do but conſider what the Glory was that he left, and what that miſery was he underwent &amp; that chearfulneſs with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he did both, &amp; his deſign in all theſe, which was only to redeem poor loſt Creatures (as for him ſelf, he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46197:176"/>could be no gainer, as appears by what he ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. <hi>Father, Glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was</hi>) and certainly it cannot but command of thee the greateſt exactneſs and circumſpection of thy life. Doeſt thou name the Name of Chriſt? Doeſt thou own theſe condeſcentions of Chriſt? and canſt thou allow thy ſelf in any kind of iniquity? it was iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that was the <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him, the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> that condemned him; it was not thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but our ſins, and will you yet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thoſe ſins? is this an ingenious requital of ſo much love? all the malice of Hell, and all the rage of adverſaries here upon earth; all the contrivances of the Jews with their great ones together could never have brought thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon Chriſt (had it not been for his love that he bore to his people) and will you for all this, after he hath done, and ſuffered ſo much, trample on his blood, and ſlight his kindneſs, and reſolve on your own ruine? and in ſpite of ſuch mercies and kindneſs, will you go on to your own deſtruction? is not this ſad? what ſhame ſhold be to all profeſſing Chriſtians that do not ſtand upon their watch, and do what they can, and make it in good earneſt their buſineſs to keep themſelves form all iniquity.</p>
            <p>The next Uſe, and the only Uſe which I ſhall add further is, by way of exhortation, that all that hath been ſaid may prevail thus far with you, to get your hearts at as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from ſin as poſſibly you are able; never think that you are too ſtrange to it, nor at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46197:177"/>enough from it: your profeſſions oblige you, your engagements oblige you; conſider, ſhould you allow your ſelves in any ſin, you thereby deſpiſe the richeſt mercy that ever was vouchſafed to poor Creatures: you that profeſs the Name of Chriſt, you that know what deſign Chriſt came into the world; follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe worthies, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.37, 38. <hi>they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder,</hi> &amp;c. and its ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>they accepted not of deliverance:</hi> You ſee how ſhie they were of ſin, and at how great a diſtance they kept from it, and what was their thoughts of it: Oh! let it be your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law died without mercy under two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. It is a common thing to ſlight it, and to ſcorn it: but what doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay to ſuch: <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>We know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, ſaith the Lord; and again, the Lord ſhall judge his people.</hi> They that profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his people, muſt be all brought to the teſt and tryal. Do you think it nothing to deſpiſe the very patience of God? to deſpiſe the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt mercy of God? take it, Friends, for a ſad truth (I ſpeak it only to awaken both my ſelf and you) there is no ſinner like unto a Goſpel ſinner, to them that go on in ſin, under thoſe means that ſhould recover them from ſin: and therefore in the day of account you read that no ſinner, ſhall have ſuch tremblings, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon them as ſinners: <hi>Sinners in Sion ſhall
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46197:177"/>be afraid, and fearfulneſs ſahll ſurpriſe the hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite:</hi> Sion ſinners, Sabbath-days, Sacrament-ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they that live under all thoſe opportunities and advantages (as their ſins bring greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God) bring greater damage to their own Souls than other ſins do: theſe of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are the fartheſt off from being renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by repentance. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. <hi>laſt.</hi> it is ſaid in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all kind of ſinners, <hi>He that ſins againſt me wrongs his own Soul;</hi> he cannot wrong God (he does indeed, what in him lies, and God may account himſelf wronged by his ſin) really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure God he cannot; our ſervices and ſins reach not him, God is infinitely above both; but he wrongs himſelf; he may wrong others by his bad example, but eſpecially he wrongs himſelf, not only in reſpect of worldly things, but he wrongs himſelf in the higheſt degrees, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> there expreſſeth it, <hi>he wrongs his own Soul:</hi> he doth not only wrong himſelf as to outward comforts, but as to his great concernments, as to his everlaſting welfare. Alas! how many be the Judgments God hath to meet with all the contemners of his mercy in this world? Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Judgments, and ſpiritual Judgments, and then conſider the Judgments of God in another world; and certainly of all perſons, thoſe that profeſs the Name of Chriſt ſhall have the foreſt; it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> in the day of Judgment than for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that had the Goſpel and <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> and ſuch priviledges, and means, and helps.</p>
            <p>Let all that hath been ſaid, perſwade you to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46197:178"/>a ſtrickt examination of your hearts and lives; that what hath been amiſs may be both ſpeedily and throughly reformed. If you do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from all iniquity, how ſad a thing will it be to you, when once Jeſus Chriſt riſeth up in Judgment againſt you? what will you plead for your ſelves, when that once Chriſt ſhall plead againſt you? even you that have deſpiſed his mercy, and refuſed Salvation, and have choſen death, and thoſe things that tend thereunto.</p>

            <p>THeſe words are a part of St. <hi>Pauls Triumph:</hi> and the evils over which he triumphs, are no leſs than all thoſe that might either <hi>endanger the welfare or disturb the peace and quiet of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi> In the Chapter before, you find him in his conflict, ſtriving with many doubts and Objections: In this Chapter you find his <hi>Faith in its elevation,</hi> as you may find in the 35 verſe, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, perſecution or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword;</hi> Nay, ſays he in verſe 37. <hi>In all theſe things we are more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</hi> And in this verſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to make a kind of Challenge to all kind of evils to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46197:179"/>do their worſt, and utmoſt; he bids defiance to them; but it is very obſervable, that all this confidence, which appeared in this great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, was not upon the account of any thing in himſelf, but only upon the account of the love of God, and the aſſurance he had of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt therein: as <hi>David</hi> when he went with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much confidence againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> it was not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrength of his own, but becauſe he went in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, whoſe Army that proud perſon had defied. Thus it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> here: And though in every E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle written by this great Apoſtle, we find him ſpeaking as becomes an Apoſtle, a perſon ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarity gifted, and called; yet in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as a Writer obſerves) St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks as if he was now raiſed up to the third Heavens, he ſpake ſuch great and mighty things, as were enough to poſe a weak and ordinary faith; as in his other writings he ſeems to be <hi>above others,</hi> ſo here he ſeems to be <hi>above himſelf,</hi> in reſpect of what he was at other times; he now ſoars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, now anſwers all his Objections. In this Triumph, here are theſe four things remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A large <hi>Catalogue,</hi> or enumeration of the <hi>ſeveral troubles</hi> that may endanger the ſafety of the people of God, and a ſeparation from the love of God; and theſe he lays down chiefly in the verſe before the Text: <hi>Neither death, nor yet life,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt is <hi>death;</hi> death ſeems to be a thing of all things the moſt formidable; its called the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> its the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to nature; but becauſe, after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46197:179"/>had mentioned ſeveral particulars in the verſe before, and in this, leſt he ſhould leave room for any Objection, that might gravel any poor doubting ſoul, he puts in <hi>Any other Creature</hi> nor this nor that, nor any thing; St. <hi>Paul</hi> does here like the wiſe King ſpoken of in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.31. in the Parable, <hi>Or what King among you, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to wage war againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſulteth whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> here <hi>computes all the troubles:</hi> he reckons the ſumm total of all the oppoſitions that Chriſtians can meet with in this world, and yet he ſees nothing diſcouraging in all theſe: that's the firſt particular; <hi>a large Catalogue,</hi> &amp;c. For while he ſays, theſe things cannot ſeparate from the love of God, he ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies thus much, that thoſe that are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the love of God, are yet liable unto theſe things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is the <hi>utter inablility</hi> of all theſe things <hi>to cauſe any diſtance</hi> between God, and any truly gratious Soul. Theſe things may ſeparate us from Friends, from Relations, from what is dear to us in this world, but <hi>not</hi> from the love of God. Alas! what breaches is God continually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon every one of us in every part of our lives? but ſuch is the union between God and every ſincere believer, that nothing can make a ſeparation here: God may be offended with his people, but nothing can ſeparate between God and his people; death cannot do it, yet death can ſeparate us from all our Creature-comforts, from all our deareſt friends; yea, it
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46197:180"/>may ſeparate the very Soul and body, and yet it cannot ſeparate from the love of God.</p>
            <p>God hath ſuch reſpect to the <hi>Souls</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>pretious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints:</hi> Yea, and their <hi>ſcattered duſt,</hi> God will take care of that, and will cauſe it to meet together again, and be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with the Soul of that Glory that is reſerved in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But then beſides the <hi>terrors of death,</hi> here are the <hi>temptations of life,</hi> the pleaſures of this life; theſe Temptations may do that upon ſome, that the terrors of death cannot do upon them; <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death,</hi> no, <hi>nor life</hi> neither, this cannot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but theſe cannot, yet <hi>other things</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us are of great influence: <hi>Angels cannot</hi> do it, they are Creatures that <hi>excel in ſtrength;</hi> ſome expound it ſo <hi>good Angels,</hi> that it is ſpoken of them <hi>by way of ſuppoſition,</hi> Gal. 1.8. <hi>If we or an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed:</hi> not that any good Angel can be ſo bad a Meſſenger as to ſet up <hi>a new Goſpel,</hi> in oppoſition to the everlaſting Goſpel of Chriſt, it is ſpoken by way of <hi>ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> ſo I find Learned Writers interpret it thus: No, <hi>good Angels cannot,</hi> its contrary to their charge and truſt; the Angels are <hi>Miniſtring Spirits ſent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>last.</hi> therefore they cannot ſo much forget their truſt, nor be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to their charge to attempt ſuch a thing, eſpecially being now confirmed in a ſtate of Grace.</p>
            <p>Others interpret it of <hi>bad Angels;</hi> now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46197:180"/>attempts theſe do make, though they are compared to a <hi>roaring Lyon, going about ſeeking whom they may devour,</hi> though they never ſo much deſire it, yet they are in Gods Chain, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Jude</hi> 6. <hi>Thoſe Angels are in Chains,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>guilty Malefactors,</hi> to be puniſhed, but as <hi>Miſchievous perſons</hi> to be reſtrained, who if they were at liberty, would do more miſchief than now they can. You may take it in this latter ſenſe, which ſeems to be moſt proper: ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels cannot do it; but there are ſeveral <hi>Ranks and Degrees</hi> among the Angels; therefore we read in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, against the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world,</hi> &amp;c. So here in the Text, we read of <hi>Principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> and <hi>Powers:</hi> As they ſaid of our Saviour, he through <hi>Beelzebub, the Chief or Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, did cast out Devils;</hi> in theſe Principalities then is the danger. But it it is not in them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I find many Interpreters carrying the ſenſe to <hi>earthly Potentates,</hi> the Rulers of his world; that they by all their Tyranny and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions (for they joyn the word <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to <hi>Powers</hi>) they can never be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all we undergo for the preſent, who knows what may follow <hi>for the future?</hi> who knows what a day may bring forth? What is in the Womb of the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? the Apoſtle anſwers this here, not <hi>things preſent,</hi> no, <hi>nor things to come:</hi> though you know not what may come upon you, yet if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, and are ſincere Believers, let
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46197:181"/>what will or can come; <hi>Nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> But there are <hi>heights and depths,</hi> that is, heights of <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and depths of <hi>Calamity,</hi> (as ſome expound it:) but leaſt the Apoſtles Catalogue ſhould not yet be ſo full to anſwer every caſe, he puts in this general, vaſt, and comprehenſive expreſſion, <hi>nor any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> If all I have ſaid be too little, and all you are able to think at preſent is not ſufficient, yet this is as much as can poſſibly be thought of, or can poſſibly befal you, <hi>nor any other Creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is <hi>the ground</hi> or foundation <hi>of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparableneſs</hi> from the love of God, that is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Alas! the love of God is not built upon <hi>any thing in us,</hi> God doth not love us upon any account of our own, but upon the account of his Son, and <hi>his Son is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like dear</hi> and pretious in his ſight; and what he hath done, and ſuffered for thoſe for whom he hath undertaken, is alike of value in his Fathers thoughts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Here is the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Apoſtles <hi>confidence,</hi> concerning all this; <hi>I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that neither,</hi> &amp;c. he was got above all doubtful ambiguities, or probabilities, or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, for, ſays he, <hi>I am fully perſwaded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. But here is an Objection, <hi>Did not this Proviledge peculiarly belong to St.</hi> Paul, <hi>and is it not above our capacity to attain to the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here not of himſelf ſingly, but of <hi>himſelf in conjunction</hi> with
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46197:181"/>others, nothing ſhall ſeparate <hi>us from</hi> the love of God, it is expreſt in the plural Number. Again, the ground and foundation upon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> bottoms this aſſurance, and this height of his confidence, it is ſuch as all ſincere Believers are capable of. You find all along in all thoſe other Priviledges that he mentions in the former part of the Chapter, all theſe he ſpeaks of, <hi>of being made partakers of the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> of <hi>walking in the Spirit, and not after the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. this is the foundation upon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> grounds his confidence, and now every ſincere Believer hath a ſhare more or leſs in all theſe: ſo much for the opening of the words.</p>
            <p>I ſhall commend ſeveral Obſervations from them, chiefly three or four: The firſt is this:</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>It is the ſingular advantage of all ſincere Believers, that what ever Comforts they may be deprived of, and whatever cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities they may undergo, yet they have this for their unſpeakable ſupport, the love of God for their portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is upon this alone that the Apoſtle grounds all his confidence and comfort: he could eaſily deſpiſe all kind of troubles, and it was only upon this account. For the opening of this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> I ſhall only give you three hints.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the peculiar Priviledge of ſuch as are ſincere, and only ſuch, that they <hi>have the love of God for their portion;</hi> for <hi>Separation implies a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union;</hi> that can never be parted, that was not before joyned; and the loſs of the love of God implies a pre-injoyment of the ſame. And then the word <hi>us,</hi> it notes a reſtriction, as it contains
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46197:182"/>and takes in all that are ſincere, ſo it bars the door againſt all others; they have no ſhare in this Priviledge: it is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, This is <hi>our</hi> Priviledge, and it is ſuch a Priviledge as we can never be deprived of: now the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of Believers in that age only, but of all that ſhould be afterwards in future generations, for <hi>whatever was written afore-time, was written for our inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>common love</hi> that God bears <hi>to all his Creatures,</hi> as they are his <hi>Creatures,</hi> the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his hands, this is extended to all his Creatures, through the whole Univerſe, and it manifeſts it ſelf in theſe four things; I ſhall but name them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>preſerving</hi> them; for as God by the Word of his Power brought all out of nothing, ſo by the ſame almighty Word of his power, he preſerves them from falling back into the firſt nothing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the word of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>providing</hi> for them; thus God is the great Maſter of all the Families in Heaven and earth; he hears the cries of the fowls of the air, he heareth the <hi>cry of the Ravens,</hi> he <hi>cloaths the Lillies of the field;</hi> many ſuch inſtances might be given of the Providence of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. <hi>The fowls of the air they ſow not neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your Heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they, He opens his hand, and fills all Creatures with good: The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou givest them their meat in due ſeaſon,</hi> Pſal. 145.15.</p>
            <pb n="307" facs="tcp:46197:182"/>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>protecting</hi> them from dangers; this in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Not a hair falls from the head, not a ſparrow falls to the ground; yet are not two Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſold for a farthing? And are you not of more value than they?</hi> Theſe are the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures, yet God hath a care of them, in protecting them; no Creature can be ſafe one moment any longer than its under the care and protection of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In this <hi>Governing</hi> all his Creatures, their actions, and occurrances, and in ordering all to his own glory, and the manifeſtation of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and goodneſs. <hi>The inviſible things of God are clearly ſeen from the Creation,</hi> Rom. 1.20. That is, his works of Providence and Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernation of the World. But this is not that I am now to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>Again, There is <hi>a love</hi> that God bears <hi>to man as man,</hi> as he is a Creature <hi>of a higher rank,</hi> and being than other Creatures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzel the mouth of the Oxe; Doth God take care of Oxen?</hi> It is provided that mercy and kindneſs ſhould be ſhewed to thoſe poor labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Creatures: Doth God enact theſe Laws-for Oxen? <hi>or ſaith he it for our ſakes? for our ſakes, no doubt, this is written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>highest teſtimony</hi> that God ſhews of his love to man, as man, was that of his Sons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him <hi>the nature of man, not the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.</p>
            <p>Yet over, and above both theſe, the love that God bears to his Creatures, as they are his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and to men as men more than to other Creatures; there is a <hi>peculiar and higher kind</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:46197:183"/>of love that God bears <hi>to his people, as they are peculiarly his:</hi> whether only <hi>as elected,</hi> God takes care to bring them into himſelf; whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God aſſigned to Glory as the end, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges to Grace as the means, to attain that end. Or, whether they be <hi>actually ſanctified,</hi> ſtill God hath a peculiar reſpect to his people, as they are peculiarly his; Therefore <hi>David</hi> begs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4, 5. <hi>Shew me the good of thy choſen, that I may rejoyce in the gladneſs of thy Nation: that I may glory with thine inheritance:</hi> God hath favour for others, but he hath a <hi>ſpecial</hi> favour for his; Now this is the great Priviledge of all ſincere Believers; beſides, the general love God hath to all Creatures, theſe he looks upon as his Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, as his darlings, as his delight, as perſons whom he ſingles out, as ſpecial Objects of his favour. That's the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Noth withſtanding this peculiar love of God to ſincere Believers, <hi>yet they may</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>be ſorely afflicted,</hi> the Apoſtle reckons up here many ſmart Afflictions; in the verſes before you read of <hi>Tribulation,</hi> and <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> and <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, famine, nakedneſs, perils, ſword, life, death, Angels, Principallities, powers.</hi> Now while the Apoſtle aſſerts ſo expreſly, that none of theſe ſhall be able to ſpearate from the love of God, he <hi>strongly implies,</hi> that thoſe that are the people of God, thoſe that are the real objects of his love, may yet <hi>be liable to all theſe;</hi> they are not exempted from any of theſe: They may be perſecuted, and yet are beloved of God; they may be exerciſed with wants, with nakedneſs, and undergo cruel uſages from <hi>men,</hi> yet belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46197:183"/>of <hi>God,</hi> under <hi>great Affliction,</hi> and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>great Affection</hi> from God: The <hi>disting uiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love</hi> of God makes <hi>no diſtinction</hi> in theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him; all things come alike to all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean and unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; as he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an Oath.</hi> Their Afflictions may be as great, nay exceed the afflictions of others, as you may ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73 both thoſe Pſalmes are upon that ſubject: as to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this life, the moſt ſincere Servants of God may have a deeper ſhare and portion in them, than they that do not own God in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>In this world you ſhall have trouble: They that will live Godly in Chriſt ſhall ſuffer perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the predictions for the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and if you look back to the experience of <hi>former Ages,</hi> the <hi>flaming buſh</hi> hath been an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme</hi> of the ſtate of Gods Church, while the Church <hi>is here;</hi> the Buſh was flaming and burning, and yet not conſumed. You ſee then, it is the Priviledge of ſincere Believers, that they have an intereſt in the ſpecial love of God; and you ſee alſo notwithſtanding, the peculiar love of God to them, they are liable to many ſmart afflictions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whatever their afflictions are, though they may be above, and grearer than others, yet notwithſtanding they have <hi>ſupports above others,</hi> even the love of God: you may ſee that this along hath been their great ſupport,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:46197:184"/>their <hi>relation</hi> to, and their <hi>intereſt</hi> in the Lord; as you may read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. when <hi>David</hi> was once ſtript of no leſs than <hi>his</hi> all, his Wives, his Cihildren, his Subſtance, his Cattle, all were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a way Captive, yet he <hi>incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God:</hi> Nay, this is the Promiſe that God hath made to his, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89.31, 32, 33, 34. ſpeaking of them them that are his in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant — <hi>If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments: Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes. Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor aleer the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> I will cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe them they ſhall know what it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me, to offend me, yet I will have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them: when it is the fouleſt weather with the people of God here below, God by his Providences doth ordinarily make it clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; when the world doth moſt frown, God doth uſually moſt ſmile; when his people are condemened of men, he then vouchſafeth them the cleareſt evidences of their acceptance with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>We are afflicted on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; perſecuted, but not forſuken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed:</hi> ſtill they had ſome relief in God, and God did let them then eſpecially find it, when they did moſt need it; this is uſually the time wherein God manifeſts more of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his people, than at other ſeaſons: it is promiſed <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.14. <hi>I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably to her.</hi>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:46197:184"/>A wilderneſs, that is a deſert, a place full of full of wants, of ſtraits and difficulties, but that ſhall be a time and place of Gods love to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. The Apoſtle found this alſo true. <hi>As our afflictions abound, ſo our conſolations do much more abound:</hi> upon this account it is, that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions when they are ſanctified, and we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported under them, and do make a right uſe of them, they are frequently mentioned is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as choice bleſſings, as eminent favours.</p>
            <p>Thus this Doctrine is cleared, <hi>Whatever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts a gracious Soul may go without, what Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it may undergo, yet it hath this unſpeakable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the love of God:</hi> this love is a peculiar love, and it doth not exempt from Afflictions, but it doth admirably ſweeten thoſe Afflictions that the Servants of God do meet with.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this Point.</p>
            <p>this <hi>Informs</hi> us of the neceſſity of an <hi>eye of Faith</hi> to enable us to <hi>make a right Judgment</hi> both of <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things:</hi> Senſe and Reaſon are incompetent Judges of things Inviſible, becauſe theſe are above Senſe, above the reach of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, many of them; we are apt to think when God ſtrips his people of their eſtates, of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts of Friends, of neer Relations, that when theſe are gone, all is gone with them, no, no, they have the love of God then; as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>I have meat that ye know not of,</hi> ſo they have comforts and refreſhments that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers know not of; <hi>Strangers cannot intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with their joy,</hi> theſe are out of the reach of all kind of enemies.</p>
            <pb n="312" facs="tcp:46197:185"/>
            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>This peculiar love of God, is ſuch a mercy, that nothing but the want of it, can make any of us miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ground upon the Text: The ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place is to comfort the people of God againſt all the diſcouragements that this life is liable to, and capable of: Now the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he alledges to this purpoſe is no more than this: <hi>Nothing can ſeparate you</hi> (ſays he) <hi>from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and in as much adds, <hi>nothing more but this;</hi> he thought he had ſpoke enough in that one word: hence I gather, it is a mercy ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that nothing but the want of this can make any of us miſerable. All the miſeries and calamities in the world, that can come upon us, cannot make us miſerable, if we may but enjoy this one thing, <hi>the love of God:</hi> it is, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, I reckon, that ſuch Afflcitions may ſeparate you from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this world, but let what affliction will, or can come upon you, they cannot ſeparate you from theſe refreſhments: this one ſingular Priviledge, the Apoſtle oppoſeth to all thoſe kinds of calamities that he had mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; though it is true, every particular calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not mentioned amongſt theſe, yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and worſt are, and the reſt are included in them.</p>
            <p>If God ſhould enlarge Satans Commiſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, as he did once againſt <hi>Job,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all we have into his hands and power; and if
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46197:185"/>Satan ſhould never fail in executing the utmoſt of that power, that God gives him; ſhould God deal thus with us, yet there is enough in the love of God to ſweeten all, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than life.</hi> So our Tranſlation reads it, but in the hebrew it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>prae vitis,</hi> that is, better than lives. The meaning of this is (as a Learned Expoſitor gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon the Text) <hi>than any kind of life;</hi> better than life, with any kind of advantages that may render it more ſweet and pleaſant to us, it is better than lives: now <hi>life</hi> you know is of all outward mercies the higheſt, for all other things are perfectly inſignificant to us without life; <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life. But thy loving kindneſs is better life:</hi> So in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee. David</hi> did not ſay, he had nothing in the world, for he had a Kingdom, a Crown, he had a great deal of worldly honours and greatneſs, but theſe were not the things he looked at; he could paſs by theſe; he eyed Communion with God, and the favour of God was more than all, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſay, who will ſhew us any good? Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine did encreaſe.</hi> Now how often did this holy man ſolace himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, his intereſt in the favour of God. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16.5, 6. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup, thou maintaineſt my Lot. The lines are fallen to me in pleaſant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46197:186"/>yea, I have a goodly heritage.</hi> There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that this holy man made his boaſt of, but only of God, and you find him often making him his glory; and truly, well might <hi>David</hi> be of this maind, well might he deſpiſe all worldly greatneſs in compariſon of God; for could he have added Kingdome to Kingdom, and world to world, all had been nothing in compariſon of him. That excellent deſcription of God in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40.12. is highly magnificent, and very helpful to raiſe up our thoughts to conſider the greatneſs of God. <hi>Who hath meaſured the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a span? &amp;c.</hi> But now to prove this truth farther, I ſhall alledge theſe ſix Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> There is <hi>nothing but the love of God can make us happy;</hi> and therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>want</hi> of this love that can make <hi>us miſerable;</hi> for miſery conſiſts in the want of ſome good, or the enduring of ſome evil. Now nothing, I ſay, can make us happy, but the love of God. It is <hi>not Honours,</hi> for, <hi>not many Noble are called:</hi> it is <hi>not Greatneſs,</hi> for Greatneſs and goodneſs do not always go together: a man may be a <hi>Great man,</hi> and withal a <hi>great ſinner,</hi> yea, a miſerable man. It is ſaid of <hi>Naaman,</hi> that he was a Great man, but withal he was a <hi>Leper,</hi> and that ſpoil'd all. It is <hi>not Riches</hi> can do it, <hi>Mans life conſists not in the abundance of the things of this world:</hi> Beſides, you read of an <hi>infamous rich man,</hi> Luke 12. he was boaſting of his barnes, and granaries, and projecting how he might pull them down, and make new kind
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46197:186"/>of ſtore-houſes for the reception of his incoms: When alas! <hi>that night his Soul ſhould be required of him.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. you read of one faring deliciouſly every day, but both of theſe were in a very ſad condition, as to their Souls; you remember the Parables. It is not <hi>Friends, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> or <hi>Relations</hi> they cannot make us happy; we find thoſe that have been under the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to abound in all theſe; no leſs than twelve Dukes proceeded from the Loyns of profance <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, it is not <hi>Creatures below us,</hi> that can make us happy; for happineſs is mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Creatures below us are below per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; nor <hi>equal with</hi> us; nay, nor <hi>above;</hi> all Creatures above us are finite, but the deſires of our hearts are infinite, and that which hath its bounds, can never ſatisfie boundleſs deſires; and where deſires are not ſatisfied, there can be no happineſs.</p>
            <p>But although God ſhould give us ſo much of the world as our own hearts can deſire or wiſh; yet if he hide his face, or ſtand at a diſtance from us, there is enough in the want of that ſingle mercy to make us altogether miſerable; therefore as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of Wiſedom, the ſame wa may ſay of the love of God, <hi>Job.</hi> 28.12, 13, 14. <hi>But where is wiſdom found, and where is the place of underſtanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of the living. The depth ſaith, it is not in me, and the Seaſaith, it is not in me.</hi> verſe 15. <hi>Gold ſhall not be given for it, neither ſhall ſilver be weighed for the price thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="316" facs="tcp:46197:187"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> The <hi>love of God</hi> is ſuch a mercy that it is abundantly ſufficient to <hi>make up the want of all other mercies,</hi> and to <hi>ſweeten</hi> the ſoureſt of all kind of <hi>Afflictions,</hi> that can befal us. God in his giving himſelf, gives us more than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comforts; what we have not in the <hi>ſtream,</hi> yet if we have it in the <hi>fountain,</hi> it is more <hi>freſh,</hi> and more <hi>delightful;</hi> ſays <hi>Bernard, Lord, where can I be well without thee, and where can I be ill if may enjoy thee? Thy favour is better than life.</hi> True, we may be impatiently deſirous of this, and that Creature-comforts, and as froward in thoſe deſires as <hi>Rachel</hi> was, when ſhe <hi>quarrelled with Jacob for Children, Give me Children, or elſe I die:</hi> we cannot live without this, and that comfort, we cannot ſubſiſt without God humor us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1. But as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah,</hi> ſo may we ſay to our ſulleneſt and moſt impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient deſires, <hi>Am not I better to thee than ten ſons?</hi> Is not God better to us than all? If God ſhould deny us this, or that, or take away this, or that Creature-comfort, is not God better to us than all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Thirdly, the love of God in its full perfection is <hi>the very happineſs of Heaven it ſelf;</hi> and ſo much as we enjoy of the love of God here on earth, ſo much we have of Heaven here on earth. The excellencie of Heaven is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>God ſhall be all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There ſhall be <hi>no marrying, nor giving in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> but we ſhall be <hi>as the Angels of God,</hi> we ſhall there have no need of theſe Comforts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there we ſhall have a full fruition of God.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46197:187"/>There ſhall be <hi>no Sun, nor Moon, nor Stars,</hi> there is no want of theſe, becauſe <hi>the Lamb is the brightneſs thereof.</hi> And if the love of God in its fulleſt perfection be the very happineſs of Heaven; then certainly nothing can make that perſon miſerable that enjoys any part of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here on earth. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of joy,</hi> yea, and that <hi>for evermore.</hi> There is much comfort in what we have of his preſence here; but what his people have of his preſence here, is but a kind of abſence to what they ſhall have hereafter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 6, 8. <hi>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord. We are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> The preſence of God which we have here, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares with the preſence which we ſhall have hereafter; and the preſence we have of God here, he accounts a kind of abſence in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that, as you may ſee by comparing thoſe two verſes together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Argument, That nothing can make a perſon miſerable, but the want of this ſpecial and peculiar love of God, it appears from the <hi>excellencie of the perſon loving; THE LOVE OF GOD:</hi> this is a great word; <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us? if God juſtifie us, who can condemn us?</hi> v. 31, 33. of this Chapt. 2 <hi>Timoth</hi> 4.16, 17. St. <hi>Paul</hi> when all forſook him, thought he had enough in this, that <hi>God stood by him. At my firſt anſwering no man ſtood by me, but all men forſook me;</hi> (this was uncomfortable in it ſelf) <hi>I pray God it may not
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46197:188"/>be not laid to their charge. Nevertheleſs, the Lord ſtood by me and ſtrengthened me.</hi> This contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that went before, this circumſtance as to the point of troubles and afflictions, becauſe there is more in God, to ſupport, and comfort, then there could be in afflictions to deject and and diſcourage.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour could not ſpeak to his Diſciples without reproving them for their cowardize, foretelling them how it ſhould ſhortly appear: <hi>You ſhall leave me alone.</hi> What? then to be left alone, when he was to go through all thoſe troubles? this was a very uncomfortable thing, <hi>yet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I am not alone, for the Father is with me,</hi> John 16.32. it is ſome <hi>refreſhment</hi> in our ſorrows, to have <hi>Friends to pity,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate us; but oh! what a refreſhment is it, to have the infinite God to love us? You know the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of all the ſorrows that our Saviour underwent during his ſufferings here on earth was, That God had withdrawn the ſenſe of his love from him, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> as for his Diſciples, their leaving of him, their turning their backs upon him, and falling off from him, theſe things he could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly bear; but Gods forſaking was the bitterneſs of his cup, and made him cry him with a loud voice, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> May be drawn from. <hi>The nature of the love of God is ſuch an eminent mercy, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make that perſon miſerable that doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this one Priviledge:</hi> becauſe,</p>
            <pb n="319" facs="tcp:46197:188"/>
            <p n="1">1. The Love of God is the <hi>tendereſt,</hi> it is the <hi>most affectionate</hi> Love. The Love of <hi>Parents</hi> is great, but the love of God is greater, Math. 5.11. <hi>If you that are evil know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more then ſhall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The love of a <hi>Mother</hi> is great, but the love of God is greater, and exceeds it, Iſa. 49 15, 16. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her Womb? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have graven thee upon the Palms of my Hands, thy Walls are continually before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tendereſt Compaſſions that can be found on Earth, come far more ſhort of the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an infinitely gratious God, then the leaſt drop of Water to the vaſt body of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. There is no proportion between theſe two. <hi>In all Afflictions</hi> of his People, <hi>he is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>afflicted,</hi> thereby intimating that he bears a part of their afflictions, and is ſharer with them in all their troubles, Iſa. 63.9. <hi>He that toucheth them, toucheth the Apple of his Eye,</hi> Zach. 2.8</p>
            <p n="2">2. The love of God, it is the <hi>truest and moſt prudent love,</hi> there is nothing of Cockering, or indulgence in it. It is no ſuch love as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the failings of his own People; no, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child whum he loves he corrects,</hi> Heb. 12.6. <hi>Judgement begins at the houſe of God,</hi> God is more quick in his chaſtiſing of them, then of others; and his love makes him to be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would recover them ſooner and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46197:189"/>their longer wandrings from him. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray; but now have I kept thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.67. Therefore he ſays to <hi>Iſrael, You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth; therefore you will I puniſh for all your Iniquities,</hi> Amos 3.2. My kindneſs to you is far above all others, therefore I will correct you, I will make you ſmart now, that you may not ſmart for ever; you ſhall new feel the bitterneſs of Sin, to bring you to Repentance, and theſe Afflictions helps in order thereunto. As concerning others (the Sinners in <hi>Zion</hi> whom God regards not) it is ſaid <hi>why ſhotld you be ſmitten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more,</hi> Iſa. 1.5. <hi>Ye will revolt yet more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a great Priviledge, and part of the Covenant, and Promiſe, that God hath made with his People, as Pſal. 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law and walk not in my Judgements; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments: Then will I viſit their Traugreſſion with the Rod, and their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with ſtripes. Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my Lips.</hi> The viſiting their trangreſſions, with a Rod, and their Iniquities with Stripes, is mentioned here, as an eminent Promiſe, and part of the Covenant of Grace. <hi>David</hi> accounted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the righteous, a great favour to him, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be a great kindneſs; let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Oyl which ſhall not break my head,</hi> Pſal. 141.5.</p>
            <pb n="321" facs="tcp:46197:189"/>
            <p n="3">3. The love of God is the <hi>moſt liberal, and bountiful love.</hi> All love is liberal, and bountiful, and according as the perſon is in ability, ſo is his love more, or leſs bountiful. It is ſaid of <hi>Abaſhuerus,</hi> he gave gifts becoming his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, ſo God gives gifts to his People, ſuitable to his greatneſs, becoming his Magnificence. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>the gift</hi> of God, and what gift could God give greater? John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever beleiveth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> He had but one only begotten Son, and he gave him, Rom. 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son but deliverd him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him, alſo freely give us all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſuch a pledge of Gods bounty, and evidence of his liberality, that we need not doubt of the goodneſs of God in other things, ſince God has given ſo high an inſtance as this; <hi>God will give grace, and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.7.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The love of God is the <hi>moſt firm, and conſtant love,</hi> alas, we are poor mutable Creatures, but God is an unchangable God, <hi>whom he loves he loves to the end,</hi> and that end is without end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the loving kindneſs of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>better then life,</hi> Pſal. 63.3. and it is better then life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, becauſe it laſts longer then life, yea then all that in life we are made Partakers of; for if a man live in God, he lives better then in all other enjoyments whatſoever.</p>
            <pb n="321" facs="tcp:46197:190"/>
            <p n="5">5. The love of God is an <hi>Omnipotent love,</hi> it is ſuch as is able to effect his good pleaſure, to them that are the objects of his love. Friends may wiſh us well, but can do no more, in ſome Caſes; but there is no bleſſing needful, there is nothing that may be helpful to us, but God is able to vouchſafe it; in him dwells infinite fulneſs, and power. Thus you ſee from theſe five Reaſons, that this peculiar love of God is ſuch a mercy, that nothing but the want of this, can make any of us miſerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application,</hi> Firſt, If it be ſo, that nothing can make that perſon miſerable, that enjoys the love of God, then certainly <hi>God is no hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> nor does he deal rigorouſly with his People, when he ſuffers them to be afflicted? Though he lets them meet with ſome troubles, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and many of them very ſmart ones too, yet all this cannot be accounted harſh dealing, becauſe nothing can make them miſerable, that are in the love of God. They may be under ſufferings, as the Apoſtles ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. They may be under ſtraits and difficulties, but in all theſe they are <hi>not forſaken, we are troubled on every ſide, but not distreſſed, we are perplexed, but not in deſpair.</hi> Caſt down, but not caſt off, afflicted but not unhappy; I ſay this may ſilence all thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and hard thoughts that our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are apt to entertain concerning <hi>God,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his providential dealings with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inference is this, If the love of God be ſuch an eminent priviledge, <hi>How dreadful then is their Caſe that are under the hatred of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46197:190"/>God?</hi> What ever hath been ſaid concerning the love God, the greateſt word that can be ſpoken of, it is the infiniteneſs thereof, that it is <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love;</hi> Now the infiniteneſs of Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred makes that as terrible and dreadful, as the other is deſireable, infiniteneſs in God, as it plainly demonſtrates God to be, on the one hand the beſt Friend, ſo on the other hand the worſt of Enemies; and as it ſpeaks his love to be the moſt deſirable portion, ſo of all kind of evils, his hatred to be the moſt formidable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Inference is this, Take notice of the <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and madneſs</hi> of thoſe Perſons, that can be <hi>patient and quiet under the diſpleaſure of God,</hi> and can content themſelves without ſeeking reconciliation to him, and being received into favour with God. Is not this the Caſe of many? is not this the Cafe of many of us? It would be well for us if we would put this queſtion home to our own Souls, you ſee nothing can make us miſerable but only the want of Gods love; the Apoſtle thought he had ſpoke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this one word, to bear up their Spirits, againſt the fear of all thoſe Calamities, which at that time were threatned, as Perſecution, Famine, Sword, Nakedneſs, Perils, of all kinds: But what ſhall bear up thoſe who have no ſhare in it? ſince there is nothing can make us happy but this love of God, there is nothing can make us miſcrable but the want of it; it is folly and madneſs in us, not ſo much as to regard this love. <hi>Why do you ſpend your money for that that is not Bread? hearken to me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and your Souls ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55.2.3.</p>
            <pb n="324" facs="tcp:46197:191"/>
            <p n="4">4. Inference, This Doctrine of admirable <hi>advantage</hi> to the People of God, <hi>under their greateſt loſſes;</hi> for whatever they may looſe they <hi>cannot looſe their interest in the love of God,</hi> not from any excellency in themſelves, but the I have given you an account of that, in that it is ſingularneſs of Gods grace and bounty to them, and his care for them, and their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>

            <p>I Shall now go on to the 6. <hi>and laſt Reaſon</hi> of this Doctrine, <hi>(That this peculiar Love of God, is ſuch a mercy, that nothing but the want of this can make any of us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe of the admirable <hi>fruits and effects</hi> of this love, in the many benefits we receive from thence, it is from the love of God, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every mercy that we enjoy, if it be but <hi>common Mercies,</hi> we receive them from the love of God.</p>
            <p>It is true, the difficulty of this Caſe is, to know whether common mercies are the Fruit of ſpecial love. That they are from the love and goodneſs of God, it's clear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. <hi>God cauſed his Sun to ſhine upon the evil, and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe mercies are common mercies, and that, they are from common bounty that is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46197:192"/>for as God is the Fountain of all good, ſo the <hi>love</hi> of God is the <hi>only Motive</hi> to incline him to do good to his <hi>Creatures;</hi> there is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them to move</hi> him to do them good, but it is his <hi>own goodneſs</hi> that moves him to it; he is the giver and beſtower of <hi>every good and perfect gift; the Father of Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether you ſpeak of common or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Mercies, all are the expreſſions of his love, common to ſome, peculiar to others; as for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercies, they are not common to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There is a vaſt <hi>difference</hi> between the mercies that God vouchſafeth to his People, and thoſe he vouchſafeth to others, the mercies the People of God enjoy are the ſpecial Fruits and benefits of his ſpecial love; and it is that upon which we ground our hopes of mercy for the future.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the love of God that <hi>makes every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> to be <hi>indeed a mercy to us;</hi> The abſence of Gods love is enough to blaſt all our choiceſt bleſſings. God may give us abundance of theſe outward bleſſings, but what are theſe unleſs he gives us his love with them. God anſwered the defires of the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they muſt have dainties, and be fed with <hi>Qualies,</hi> but with all he <hi>ſent leanneſs into their Souls,</hi> they had thoſe ſweet dainties, with bitter Sauce. So it is ſaid again of ſome of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 69.22. <hi>Their Table became a ſnare before them,</hi> which is quoted again in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.9. Alas, while we remain under the diſpleaſure of God, though out of his common bounty, he may give us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many comforts; yet theſe are but like the waters of <hi>Marah;</hi> there is nothing but
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46197:192"/>bitternes in them. God may feed us perhaps very plentifully with outward enjoyments, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to fatneſs, but this fatneſs will be but to deſtruction, and ſlaughter. As they cryed out to the Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.40. <hi>Death is in the Pot;</hi> ſo death is in all our enjoyments, if we have not the love of God with them.</p>
            <p>But, when we can read an Inſcription of love in every comfort, and the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhining through every mercy; this ſets Mercies at a higher rate. Herein is the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the People of God and others; they may enjoy the ſame Mercies; but the ſame Mercies are a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the one, and a <hi>Curſe</hi> to the other; they may partake of the ſame outward Priviledges, but not with the ſame inward Sweetneſs. The ſame <hi>Cloud</hi> that was <hi>a light to the Iſraelites,</hi> was <hi>darknes to the Aegyptians;</hi> The ſame <hi>Ark</hi> that was for <hi>ſafety to the Iſraelites,</hi> was for <hi>deſtruction</hi> to the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines;</hi> The ſame <hi>Red Sea</hi> that was a <hi>Wall of</hi> ſafety to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was a Floud to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The People of God have the ſame Mercies that others have, but God gives them grace to make a right uſe of them, for ſpiritual ends, and advantages, and ſo to them they better Mercies. God doth not onely give to them Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, but hearts to improve them, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the pure, all things are pure,</hi> &amp;c. Mark; let them be what things they will, <hi>all</hi> is pure to them; <hi>but to the impure and defiled all things are defiled.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. It is the love of God, that is not unly the Fountain of all good, and makes every thing to be indeed good, but this love makes all <hi>the evils</hi> that we meet with <hi>to be good</hi> to us; it makes burthens light, yokes eaſie. Sometimes it does ſo <hi>literally,</hi> as in the Caſe of the <hi>three Children;</hi> God ſo love them, that he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heat of the Fire, that not ſo much as a Hair of their Heads was ſinged, or their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſcorcht: But in a <hi>ſpiritual Compenſation</hi> god is never wanting to his People. Thoſe ſuffering <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, ſome of them found thoſe ſcorching Flames, as ſo many Beds of Roſes, ſo full were they of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the ſenſe of Gods love to them, they were above the ſenſe of any kind of trouble or torture; though in it ſelf, it could not be thought little. Nay, the love God hath a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ingred iency into Calamities, in the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his People; it hath ſingular Efficacy to take away the bitterneſs of Afflictions. How to ſome did the love of God make their ſhame glorious, and their dolorous Afflictions to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful? it is ſaid of the Apoſtles, that they went away from the Counſel <hi>rejoycing that they were thought worthy to ſuffer for the ſake of Chriſt.</hi> Rejoycing that they were graced with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; they looked upon theſe as their Crowns, and their glory. What is ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Phyloſophers Stone, (whether it be fabulous or ont I will diſcourſe) that it turns all into Gold that it toucheth; The ſame may be applied to the love of God, it puts good into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil thing. If we can be but made Partakers of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46197:193"/>his love, it is ſuch a moſt excellent priviledge, that nothing then can hurt us, or make us mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: True, our own unbelief, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may keep us off from the comfort of this love many times; but this is a certain Rule, <hi>Every thing hath only ſo much of good in it, as it hath of Gods love in it,</hi> if Gods love be in our Afflictions, then this puts Sweetneſs into our Afflictions; and that partly by the <hi>Addition of ſome good</hi> by them, and partly by <hi>abſtracting of ſome evil;</hi> namely, of our minds from outward things, and by ſetting them upon higher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An other effect of this love of God, is this? it <hi>makes us good in our ſelves,</hi> it is the love of God that is the only Fountain of all the grace, that any heart of us here hath had wrought in it. <hi>Who made the oh man to differ? or what haſt thou that thou haſt not received!</hi> What thou haſt received it is of grace, not of debt, it is the love of God that does not only lay the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of grace, but that does carry out the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure</hi> of grace, he that is the beginner, the <hi>Author,</hi> he is the <hi>increaſer</hi> of all good) nay he likewiſe <hi>preſerves it;</hi> God from his love to his People, takes care to preſerve that grace he hath wrought in them. Indeed, if God did not take care to preſerve grace where it is once wrought, it would then ſoon dye, and vaniſh and come to nothing; grace in us, and the working of it at firſt, is no leſs then a Miracle, becauſe our hearts are ſo uncapacitated, &amp; ſo full of perverſe Principles for the Reception of this work at firſt; and the preſerving of it, when
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46197:194"/>it is wrought, is as miraculous that grace ſhould be kept alive in us, it is as much as a ſpark of Fire to be kept alive in a whole Ocean of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; That weak grace, when it is in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſo many ſtrong Corruptions, and thoſe having ſuch aides, and aſſiſtances, from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Worlds and the Devils temptations, that grace ſhould yet live, it is the <hi>Lords doings</hi> and it <hi>is marvelous in our Eyes.</hi> In the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. it is ſaid of the ſincere People of God, that they are <hi>kept by the power of God through Faith unto ſalvation,</hi> not by any power of their own, but by the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and it is no leſs then a Mighty Power of God, that can keep them. I ſay it is the love of God that does begin and increaſe, and preſerve grace, and excites, and and conſerves <hi>and eſtabliſheth it; it is a good thing to have the heart ſtabliſhed with Grace,</hi> it is God muſt quicken it; grace in us would other wiſe be but a heavy and dull thing, if God ſhould not by the Gales of his Spirit blow up thoſe Sparks that are in the hearts of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Thus I have gone over the Doctrinal part, you ſee the peculiar love that God bears to all ſincere Believers, is a priviledge ſo vaſtly great, that thoſe that do partake of this priviledge, nothing can make them miſerable. For this one ſingle priviledge, the Apoſtle oppoſeth againſt the all Calamities, that this life is capable of; as <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, Famine, Sword, Nakedneſs,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Applic.</hi> There are only 2. things that I ſhall ſpeak to by way of Information. 1. If it be ſo, that the love of God is enough to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46197:194"/>ballance, to Counterpoyſe, all the Calamities that this life is capable off; Then this may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us: That the <hi>love of God is the higheſt and moſt tranſcendent Priviledge</hi> that man is capable of. What ever delight or comfort we find in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature enjoyment, they have this double vanity in them, and the love of God is above them.</p>

            <p>If we look upon the dangers that we lye open to, the love of God (if we have an intereſt in that) ſets us on a Rock that is higher then all Waves, and will ſhelter us from all Storms; it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a Treaſury of Mercy, that is ſufficient to ſupply all wants. It is an ordinary ſaying the <hi>Kings preſence makes the Court;</hi> ſo I may ſay of the preſence of the <hi>King of glory;</hi> where ever he is, there is comfort and happineſs, and where can his preſence more properly be ſaid to be, then where his love is?</p>
            <p>The <hi>God is an univerſal good,</hi> I think I need not ſtand to clear, that hath been cleared by the <hi>Heathen:</hi> Therefore the names that many of the antient Phyloſophers gave God was, that he is a <hi>God of truth</hi> and he is <hi>an univerſal good,</hi> and as God is ſo <hi>in himſelf,</hi> ſo his love makes him thus

I will fill them, ſaith God. Do but look upon thoſe demenſions (concerning the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus) mentioned in the <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18.19. It is a love that <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> indeed there is a ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradition in the words. <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is th breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth; And to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth Knowledge.</hi> Know that, that can never be known. We may know that <hi>experimentally;</hi> that can never known <hi>Comprehenſively.</hi> There is height, and depth, and length, and breadth, and all theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all kind of Meaſure; and therefore the moſt experience Chriſtians, when they have ſpoken of the love of God, inſtead of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, have made uſe of Admirations, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love that Father hath bestowed is pon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God;</hi> it was ſuch a manner of love, that he was unable to expreſs it, and none is able to underſtand it, nor to comprehend it.</p>
            <p>But let our Caſe be what it will; in having his favour, we have all we want; if God takes away our comforts; we have thoſe comforts, when they are removed, though not <hi>formally,</hi> yet <hi>equivalently:</hi> or elſe how can thoſe ſeeming Contradictions be rechnicled? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.5.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46197:195"/>where God hath promiſed to be <hi>a Father to the Fatherleſs, and a Husband to the Widdow.</hi> To be <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> and yet to have a <hi>Father</hi> is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; to be a <hi>Widdow,</hi> and yet to have a <hi>Husband?</hi> They ſhall have theſe virtually in God; they ſhall have the comfort of theſe. God in the ordinary way of his providence comforts, refreſheth his People by theſe ordained things; but yet, as God gives theſe outward things, ſo he makes them refreſhing to us; for theſe cannot do it alone: <hi>Man lives not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Now as God in the ordinary courſe of Providence, refreſheth his People by theſe helps; ſo he can without theſe helps, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his People immediately by himſelf.</p>
            <p>That is the firſt, out Creature comforts are <hi>Scant;</hi> they will ſerve in <hi>ſome Caſes</hi> but <hi>not in all:</hi> but the love of God is of that univerſal extent, that it reacheth <hi>every Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is this vanity in all our Creature comforts, they are <hi>but ſhort.</hi> They may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing for a while, but they do not continue; it is not long that they can continue. <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs and the glory thereof as the Flower of the Field, the Graſs withereth, and the Flower fadeth but the word of the Lord endures for ever:</hi> So we may ſay of all our Earthly enjoyments. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfections.</hi> I have lookt upon all the deſireable things in this world, and I have ſeen an end of them, that is; all theſe perfections. <hi>But thy Commandments</hi> (the comforts and priviledges built upon the Word of God) <hi>theſe are exceeding broad.</hi> Alas,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46197:196"/>as to all our Creature enjoyments in this world, we are in a double capacity of looſing the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them. <hi>They are Mortal and may die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</hi> How many are there that have out lived their comforts, and all that hath been dear to them in this world?</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>we are mortal</hi> and we may <hi>dye before them:</hi> But the love of God is an everlaſting love. Everlaſtingneſs being added to any thing it puts an infinite value upon it.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>the Joyes of Heaven</hi> are ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently glorious becauſe they are everlaſting. If there were any probability of an end to be put to thoſe Joyes, it would daſh all the glory of Heaven; and Heaven it ſelf would be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Heaven to the People of God, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. concerning the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Heaven, the Prophecies of an other world, and the priviledges of the Godſpel, ſay, he, <hi>If we had hope in Christ in this world only, we were of all perſons the moſt miſerable.</hi> Did they not enjoy ſome thing of God here? yes, but they had hopes of a <hi>full enjoyment</hi> of God <hi>for ever:</hi> Alas, to fall ſhort of theſe hopes, and to be kept out of theſe enjoyments, theſe fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions times beyond what the diſappointments, that carnal worldlings would meet with in their diſappointmets.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the <hi>Torments of Hell</hi> are therefore ſo dreadful, becauſe they are everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it there were but any probabiltiy of a releaſe from thoſe Torments, there would in a manner be no knid of Hell, to what now it is;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46197:196"/>if once there were any hopes, that the Worm would dye, and the Fire go out. <hi>Everlaſting</hi> adds a great deal of weight to any thing, and makes it highly tranſcendent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>State of Innocency</hi> was far ſhort of our State of Recovery; becauſe that was a muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State: Man was left to the freedom of his will; he had power to ſtand, and ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, all oppoſitions, and temptations; but ſtill he was left to a mutable will. But our eſtate of Recovery, is another kind of Eſtate; (as to our ſecurity in it) becauſe it depends upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. (as I ſhall ſhew when I come to ſpeak of that part of the Text) The love of God <hi>is a fixt</hi> love, becauſe it is in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apl.</hi> For the <hi>Application</hi> of this point. How abundantly well are they provided for, that have the love of God for their portion? though they have nothing elſe, though they have not a a Friend on Earth, yet if they have the God of Heaven to be their Friend, if they have God to own and ſtand by thm they have enough. This was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> comfort, <hi>Though no man ſtood by me, yet the Lord ſtood by me,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.16.17. Though thou haſt no eſtate, nor Friend, nor Creature comfort, yet in having the love of God thou haſt all; nay ten thoſand times more then all. You may judge what a refreſhing it was to the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9.23. <hi>At the beginning of thy Supplications the Commandment came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee; for thou art greatly beloved;</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> was ready to faint under his Viſion in the 10. Chap. 7.8. in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46197:197"/>the 11. verſe; <hi>O Daniel greatly beloved!</hi> what greater word could be ſpoken then this? A man greatly beloved of the great God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Happy is the People that is in ſuch a caſe, yea happy is that People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let our condition be what it will in all other reſpects, yet if we have but this ſingle privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is enough in this alone to make us happy. Though we be under reproaches as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> was, yet he be being clear in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God, that he had a Conſcience void of offence both towards God and towards man, he trampled on thoſe Reproaches: Its <hi>a ſmall thing for me to be judged by mans Judgment.</hi> We paſs <hi>through good report and ill report.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our condition be <hi>want,</hi> what can he want, who hath an intereſt in him, in whom is infinite fulneſs? If our condition be <hi>Sufferings,</hi> what ſuffering can be harſh to them that have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and love of God to ſweeten them? Here is our ſtrength and comfort indeed, but if God with hold his love, or ſuſpend the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, where are we? <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf which is the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> is no terrour to us if we have but the love of God; there is enough in that to turn the dark Valley of the ſhadow of death, into a pleaſant entry into everlaſting glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Though I walk through the Valley of the the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil: For thou art with me, thy Red, and thy Staff they comfort me.</hi> Why? becauſe thou art with me; with me? why God is with all his Creatures, he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where. Yea, but with me in thy favour, and love, and care, and tenderneſs, to uphold, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46197:197"/>and comfort me, when none elſe can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Appl.</hi> The next uſe is by way of <hi>examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> You ſee this priviledge is highly great; it is no ſmall matter any of us, to know in what poſture we ſtand in reference to it. It is our great, and cheif concern, for all depends upon this; theefore let me perſwade you from hence to examine your intereſt in the love of God. And although the love of God as it is in him, is ſecret and inviſible to us; yet it diſcovers its ſelf in its Fruits and Effects, ſo that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſcoverable. There are many hidden Cauſes, but they may be diſcovered by their effects; as we know the nature of a Tree by the Fruit, and the nature of a Fountain by the Stream. Now if we would know the love of God to us, the trueſt way to diſcern it, is by our love to God. Examine your ſelves by this, 1 John 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> If thou haſt any ſpark of love to God, to his truth, to his ways, to his ordinances, to his People, all theſe are as ſo many Fruits of his love to thee. He loved thee firſt, and that love kindled in thy heart a love to him. Love to God is a ſpark that comes from Heaven. But you will ſay our love to God may be as hidden and difficult a thing for us to diſcern in regard (eſpecially) of the deceitfulneſs of our hearts, as the love of God to us is. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turn you to one place of Scripture, Joh. 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Comandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46197:198"/>to him.</hi> He is loved of God that keeps his Commandments, that is, that makes it his deſign, and endeavour ſo to do. Now conſider what love do you find in your hearts towards God, his truth and his ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from hence you may reaſonably conclude his love to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Rule by which we may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diſcerning whether we have any right or title to the love of God, is this. What? have you received <hi>thoſe Mercies</hi> from God <hi>that are the infallible Pledges</hi> of his peculiar love? there are no kind of outward Mercies, almoſt but God may and does ſometimes beſtow thoſe things in anger; God anſwered the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in many of their raſh requeſts in anger, he gave them quailes in anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, theſe outward Mercies at beſt, (if they do not come in anger) are but Fruits of Gods common bounty. But now what Mercies do you parta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46197:198"/>his People above others, the body of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Theirs is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this Mercy, though it be a more limited Mercy then ordinary and common Mercies are, yet is no ſuch diſtinguiſhing Mercy, but that we may be Partakers of it, and yet not have an intereſt of Gods peculiar love. This ſadly appears, for alas how many are there that live under the Goſpel, and yet are ſo far from reaping that ſalvation which the Goſpel brings, that it only heightens their miſery and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? How many woes did our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt thoſe Cities, that enjoyed the Goſpel in ſo great a plenty, and yet lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proffitably under theſe Inſtructions? I do wiſh that we all may take warning by their woe.</p>
            <p>But the Pledges of Gods peculiar love, are cheifly <hi>the Operations of his Spirit upon our hearts.</hi> Now what convincing Operations have you found upon your hearts, in the firſt workings of the Spirit of God? though his work be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yet it begins in Convictions. <hi>I will ſend another Comforter, and he ſhall convince the world of ſin.</hi> Joh. 16.8. Are you ſo convinct of ſin, as to be brought off from it? to have your hearts ſet againſt it? though you cannot be free from ſin, yet this is your burthen and your lamentation, and you groan under it. It is with you as it was with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the body of this death,</hi> that is of ſin that I carry about with me. Do you partake of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46197:199"/>the graces of Gods Spirit? the inlightning, the quickening, the renewing, the ſanctifying graces thereof? Do you find your hearts, to be warmly affected with the things of God, &amp; of Heaven? you cannot lightly paſs by theſe things if you are his: Are you acquainted with the Supports of Gods Spirit in the mideſt of your diſtreſſes? there are none of you but may be in troubles, and yet may have many falſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports (I grant) as natural ſtourneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles, may carry men far: But are you acquainted with the comforts of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, have they been your ſupport? Again, hath God not only vouchſafed you the means of grace, but hath he taught you to profit by thoſe means, and to entertain them in their efficacy, plainneſs and power? Does God pleaſe not to let you alone in your ſins? For God to leave us to be peaceable &amp; quiet, in our ſins, is a very ſore Judgement. Laſtly, do you ſtill find upon every relapſe and failing, your hearts deeply ſenſible thereof, and affected therewith? then may you comfortably ſay, theſe are the diſtinguiſhing Mercies indeed, and conclude they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with his peculiar love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What are the <hi>ſecret workings of your hearts</hi> towards God? what are your deſigns? your thoughts? your endeavours ingaged upon? is it to purſue the World? is it to ſtop every Door, at which danger and trouble may enter? or is it to approve your hearts to God, and to mind your duty, and in a way of well doing, to commit your ſelves to him? is this your care? this you may know by the ſecret workings of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46197:199"/>your Hearts, and by a ſerious Reflection upon all the paſſages of your Lives.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What is <hi>the meaſure by which</hi> you meaſure and <hi>paſs a Judgement</hi> upon all kinds of Objects? Do thoſe things ſeem moſt hateful to you, that are loathſome to God? and you moſt careful to ſhun that, which may hinder you from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this love of God, or a clear ſenſe of this love? therefore do you hate ſin, and vanity, and all thoſe things, that ſtand in oppoſition to this Priviledge? do you make this your Rule, to value Ordinances at a high rate by, becauſe theſe are of great advantage to you, in reſpect of your Communion with God, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his love and favour? and do you mourn, and lament the removal of theſe, or your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtraitened, as to theſe kind of advantages upon the account, in reference to the love of God, becauſe you cannot have theſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of Communion with him? Conſider, and ſeriouſly bring home theſe things to your own hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appl.</hi> In the next place I ſhall only ſpeak to one uſe more, that is by way of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> If it be ſo then, if you find it is thus with you upon your examination, that you have indeed warrantable hopes of claiming an intereſt in the peculiar love of God; Then labour to anſwer this <hi>love of God,</hi> with <hi>love to God,</hi> love in any is engaging; love in Superiours is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging; but love in God is infinitely more, who is able to return love for his love. There are theſe five hints I ſhall leave with you by way of direction.</p>
            <pb n="342" facs="tcp:46197:200"/>
            <p n="1">1. Let this love of God be a powerful <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon your hearts to do all the duty</hi> that God requires. Let Gods love thaw your Icy hearts, and cauſe them to melt and flow into every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you.</hi> The love of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining not only to do all, but to do all out of love, and not to think his Commandments greivous, or his Yoke heavy; but to ſerve him with the chearful compliance to his will in all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments: and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandmenes are not grievous.</hi> And this is when we account every thing of duty our reward; when we look on our work, as our ways. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>In keeping of thy Commandments there is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. Mark; he doth not ſay [there <hi>ſhall be</hi>] but <hi>there is in</hi> it great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is nothing that God commands us, if we did but rightly underſtand our ſelves, but it would be upon its own account, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and deſireable; however we may take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at ſeveral duties that God requires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they croſs our corrupt nature; as mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſelf denial and the like; yet all theſe duties are of ſo high an advantage, that an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſon, (if there was nothing of command in them) yet would think there is enough in their own excellency, to engage us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them. That's the firſt hint, if we have any ground to hope that the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Manifeſt your love to God by a <hi>through
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46197:200"/>deteſtation, and a careful avoiding of what ever might offend him. You that love the Lord hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Pſal. 97.10. <hi>The love of God</hi> (the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>conſtrains us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. The love of God to us and the love we have to him, it lays a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſity upon us; it not only conſtrains us to mind our duty more ſeriouſly but it wreſts ſin out of our hearts and hands, and engages to oppoſe every thing that is offenſive to God, who ſhews ſo much of favour and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us. <hi>I charge you</hi> ſaith the Spouſe <hi>that you wake not my Love till he pleaſe,</hi> Cant. 2.7. She was careful that he ſhould not be diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others, how much more not to be ſo by her ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Manifeſt your love by a <hi>good conſtruction</hi> and interpretation <hi>of all Gods providences: Love thinks no evil.</hi> Harbour therefore no hard thoughts of God. Do <hi>not charge him fooliſhly</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Job</hi>) in all his ſufferings he did not charge God fooliſhly. This is a high expreſſion of a grateful ſenſe of Gods love to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our love of God, if we think well of God, what ever he doth with us. Providence is an uncertain Rule by which to walk in judging of Gods love. <hi>Gods ways are in the Sanctuary, his Paths are in the deep Waters, Clouds and thick darkneſs are round about him; but all his ways are Righteouſneſs and Judgement,</hi> Pſal. 97.2. Manifeſt your love by a patient ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all the diſpenſations of God, and by a good conſtruction of all his Providences.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Manifeſt your love to God by a <hi>chearful undergoing</hi> all <hi>afflictions in the cauſe of God.</hi> It is for your Lord; for him that hath done and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46197:201"/>ſuffered ten thouſand times more for you, then poſſibly you can do for him. Manifeſt your love by a cheerful ſubmiſſion, when your Caſe is clear in doubtful things, the Caſe will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> rejoyced that they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reproach and diſhonour in the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Manifeſt your love to God, <hi>in labouring to bring others</hi> to partake of the love of God. You that ſee ſome ground in your ſelves, to hope that you have an intereſt in the love of God, be actively diligent to help others what you can, to get an intereſt in this love; for this is a high teſtimony of our love to God. Peter <hi>loveſt thou me? Feed my Sheep,</hi> Joh. 21.16, 17. you know how our Saviour repeated it three times, to ſhew that he would take this very well at his hands.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place one word more to them, who have good hopes, that theſe great things do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them. <hi>Labour to keep up a freſh and lively ſenſe of Gods love</hi> in your hearts. Though the love of God be invariable thus far, <hi>whom he loves he loves for ever;</hi> yet the ſenſe of this love is very mutable. Be very careful therefore to keep your Evidences clear and unſpotted; do not blot them by ſin. <hi>David</hi> loſt the ſenſe of Gods love for a long time, by thoſe great lapſes of his, and though. God had pardoned him, and did yet love him; yet it was a long time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did recover the ſenſe of it. Be diligent in the uſe of thoſe Ordinances, by which the ſenſe of Gods love is moſt cleared, and kept freſh in your hearts. Alas thoſe, that do the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46197:201"/>moſt partake of the love of God, may have their ebbings, and flowings, as to the ſenſe thereof, in Joh. 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me, and be that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> If we would have further manifeſtations of the love of God, we muſt go on in ways of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God. Be therefore often Communing with your own hearts, and looking into your own Souls, and conſider your ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how matters ſtand between God and you.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>other hand</hi> I ſhall ſpeak one word to them, who upon examination find <hi>ground to fear,</hi> that they are rather under Gods diſpleaſure, then intitled to his peculiar love, that are rather the objects of his wrath, then the ſubjects of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love. Oh <hi>think what a woful estate</hi> thou art in. Oh think what comforts thou by thy negligence and diſobedience haſt deprived thy ſelf of. Think what dangers thou lieſt open to every moment, there is nothing between thee, and everlaſting miſery, but a fraile life; and the thread of this life how ſoon God may cut it aſunder, none knows. Think what <hi>uncomfortable,</hi> and an <hi>unſafe</hi> eſtate thou art in. Do as <hi>David</hi> in another Caſe did: He would <hi>not give ſleep to his Eyes, nor ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to his Eye lids, till he had provided a place for the Ark of God.</hi> So do you give all diligence, that you may attain reconciliation to God, and an intereſt in this great priviledge, that you have heard of this day, of the love of God.</p>

I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on theſe things further. There is this vanity in the beſt of all our Creature enjoyments, that there will be (nay there cannot but be) a parting with them.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46197:202"/>cannot rationally but think (if he does not, he does but delude himſelf) that he cannot carry his riches with him into the other World, to bribe the Flames of Gods wrath, to corrupt the Executioner of Gods Vengeance.

               <hi>Your Fathers where are they? the Prophets do they live for ever,</hi> Zach. 1.5. obſerve this general Rule; there is no Fixation, no ſtability in any thing, but in this only; <hi>viz.</hi> the love of God.</p>
            <p>For the clearing of this obſervation I ſhall ſpeak to 2. things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Something by way of <hi>Explication.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Something by way of <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. By the way of <hi>Explication,</hi> rightly to ſtate the Caſe concerning the love of God, and to ſet truth its due bounds: This I ſhall do by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding ſeveral diſtinctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between the <hi>common love</hi> of God, which manifeſts it ſelf onely in common Mercies, in preſerving us and provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us theſe outward things; <hi>and the ſpoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al love</hi> of God which conſiſts in diſtinguiſhing, diſcriminating Mercies. Now it is plainly clear, that the Apoſtle cannot ſpeak here of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love of God; becauſe this love may be removed, and turned into hatred. God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great deal of love to <hi>Saul,</hi> in chuſing him out of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be head over his People, and <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf was at firſt very ſenſible of the goodneſs, and love of God to him in this reſpect; and therefore when <hi>Samuel</hi> tells him how God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.21. had choſen him to be the head of his People, <hi>Saul</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid <hi>am not I a Benjamite of the ſmallest of the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>and my Family the leaſt of all the Families of the Tribes of</hi> Benjamin? <hi>Wherefore then ſpeakeſt thou ſo to me?</hi> he thought this was too much kindneſs, to be ſhewed to ſuch a mean and unworthy perſon as he was.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46197:203"/>Nay in the beginning of his Reign God did wonderfully honour him, both in giving him the hearts of his People; its ſaid <hi>God touched the hearts of his People,</hi> chap. 10.26. and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in giving him ſucceſs againſt his Enemies: Yet after all theſe favours which were but Fruits of common love, <hi>Saul</hi> for his diſobedience was caſt of: <hi>He</hi> firſt <hi>rejected God;</hi> and then <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him,</hi> 1 Joh. 15.23. when <hi>Samuel</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated with <hi>Saul,</hi> and told him, he had not executed the Commiſſion he had received from the Lord, he had not deſtroyed all the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi> according to the Commandments of God; he pleaſed himſelf with a fine excuſe, <hi>the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple took of the cheif of the things to Sacrifice to the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22, 23. Saith <hi>Samuel; hath the Lord as great delight in burnt Offerings and Sacrifices, as in obeying the voyce of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better then Sacrifice; and to hearken then the fall of Rams. For Rebellion is as the ſin of Witchcraft, and stubborneſs of iniquity and idolatry: Becauſe thou haſt rejected the word of the Lord, he hath alſo rejected thee from being King.</hi> Here was firſt favour from God, and then anger: but this was but the common favour of God: The Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of this. So concerning that caſe, the proſperity of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which hath ſo much ſtaggered the faith of Gods People, and put them to a <hi>non plus. Why do do the wicked proſper?</hi> what expoſtulations do we find, not only in <hi>David,</hi> but in many other holy men in Scripture? in this Caſe, God may be bountiful to all men, but this is but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love. But now if we ſpeak of what love
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46197:204"/>the Apoſtle ſpeaks of here, it is ſpecial love which is manifeſted in diſtinguiſhing Mercies; in thoſe <hi>Gifts and Graces, that are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Rom. 11.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between the peculiar love of God <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and the appearance <hi>and evidence of it</hi> to our apprehenſion. This love in it ſelf hath a real conſtancy, though in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions it may be ſeemingly uncertain. God is ever careful to love his People, with this peculiar love <hi>really,</hi> though this love may <hi>not always</hi> be <hi>viſible,</hi> and apparant to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. read there the complaint of the Church, and the Church is as dear to God, as the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Wife is to the tendereſt Husband, She is ſaid to be betrothed to God, nay God is ſaid to marry her, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. yet you ſee the Church complains. <hi>And Zion ſaid the Lord hath forſaken me, and my Lord hoth forgotten me.</hi> Not only forſaken, but forgotten; not only caſt out of doors, but quite caſt of; this was the ſenſe ſhe had of her own Caſe. But God anſwered that Objection with many comfortable and gracious promiſes in the verſe following. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her Womb? yea they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</hi> I might bring a whole Cloud of Witneſſes to prove this truth, that the love of God is real and conſtant, when in our apprehenſions it ſeems to be uncertain; and that he then loves us when he ſeems to have taken off his love from us, Pſal. 77.7, 8. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble no more? is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46197:204"/>his promiſe fail for ever more? hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender Mercies,</hi> Selah. Shut them up that there is no hope of future Mercies. <hi>I ſaid this is my Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: but I will remember the years of the right band of the moſt High.</hi> This was the Fruit of his deliberation, when he had recollected his thoughts, this was my weakneſs, it was not ſo with God; Gods love is certain and conſtant. It is many times with gracious Souls, that are beloved of God with a peculiar love, as it was with <hi>Hagar,</hi> ſhe wept and lamented; ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her ſelf and Child as hopeleſs, till the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel opened her Eyes to ſee the Well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.16. <hi>And ſhe went and ſate her down over against him a good way off, as it were a Bow ſhot: For ſhe ſaid, let me not ſee the death of the Child. And ſhe ſate over againſt him, and lift up her voyce and wept, And God heard the voyce of the Lad: and the Angel of God called to</hi> Hagar <hi>out of Heaven, and ſaid unto Her, what aileth thee</hi> Hagar? <hi>fear not; for God bath heard the voice of the Lad where he is,</hi> 19. verſe <hi>God opened her Eyes, and ſhe ſaw a Wall of Water: and ſhe went, and filled the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with Water, and gave the Lad to drink.</hi> Her Bottle was ſpent, her hope was quite gone, but God opened her Eyes. So it is ſaid of the Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.15. when he ſaw ſuch a multitude that came againſt him and his Maſter. <hi>And when the Servants of the man of God was riſen early and gone forth, behold, an Hoſt compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the City both with Horſes and Chariots. And his Servants ſaid unto him, alas my Maſter, how ſhall we do? And he anſwered fear not: for they that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46197:205"/>be with us, are more then they that be with them. And Eliſha prayed and ſaid Lord I pray thee open his Eyes, that he may ſee. And the Lord opened the Eyes of the young man, and he ſaw and behold the Mountain was full of Horſes and Chariots round about</hi> Eliſha. This Eye is the Eye of Faith; now when this Eye of Faith is dim. objections are raiſed; but when God opens this Eye, this diſpels all theſe Objections. How ever the love of God is conſtant, though to our ſenſe and apprehenſion, it may many times be over cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dark, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. you read of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light walking in the darkneſs,</hi> thoſe to whom comfort was their right and priviledge; they who had a real Title to it, yet thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light ſate in darkneſs. This is the Caſe of many gracious Souls. I add this to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as it is the diſtinguiſhing love of God, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the Text, ſo it is the diſtinguiſthing love of God, as to its reallity, not to its viſibility.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt <hi>distinguiſh</hi> between the love of God <hi>in its ſelf,</hi> and various <hi>degrees</hi> of this love. I grant not only in appearance but in reallity, God may withdraw his love many degrees (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the effects of this love, for the afflictions admits not of more or leſs) we may be ſeparated from this love of God ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but we are never ſeparated from it total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or all together. God may leſs love us (in the ſence above noted) but not ceaſe to love us: there may be ſome little intermiſſion, though there is no total ceſſation; that canot be: God hath promiſed, Heb. 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> There is a great many
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46197:205"/>Negations in the original; no leſs then <hi>five,</hi> in that one place, I will not, I will not, I will not, I will not, I will not. Now for the clearing of this, let me ſpeak to ſome particulars, becauſe all depends upon this, this is the main thing in this point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God may withdraw the manifeſtation of his love <hi>in Temporal bleſſings,</hi> when he doth <hi>not in Spiritual.</hi> We are apt to judge of Gods love to us by theſe outward comforts, and when theſe are removed, we are then apt to think that Gods love is reſtrained, as <hi>Gideon</hi> argues in <hi>Judges</hi> 6.10.13. when they were oppreſſed ſo much for the Midianites. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and ſaid unto him, the Lord is with thee, the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that our Fathers told us of; ſaying, did not the Lord bring us up from</hi> Egypt? <hi>but now the Lord hath forſaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the</hi> Midianites. This was by reaſon of their oppreſſion and outward troubles. God may withdraw the manifeſtation of his love as to Temporals: But as God may beſtow tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies in anger, ſo he may remove theſe favours. For example: when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſo nice and dainty, that they muſt be fed with Curioſities, God anſwered their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.15. but with all <hi>he ſent leaneſs into their Souls.</hi> They had better have been without theſe comforts, then to have had them on theſe Terms. So God may love, and doth love, his People, when he doth not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his love in temporal bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God may ſuſpend the manifeſtation of his love <hi>in ſpiritual Comforts,</hi> when he doth not
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46197:206"/>ſuſpend his love <hi>in ſpiritual Graces.</hi> This is a higher degree. For Example: when God ſends his Spirit to Convince a poor Sous, to humble it, to wound it, thereby to prepare it for mercy; there is little of comfort viſible now in this, <hi>John.</hi> 16.8. this is the Method, wherein God promiſeth his spirit to be a Comforter; firſt to convince of ſin, then to comfort. Firſt to humble, and then to exalt. After theſe wounds, and bruiſes, and caſtings down, theſe diſtreſſes of Spirit into which the Soul is brought; then to bind up, and comfort: There is at preſent ſeen little of love all this while; and yet there is a great deal of this reallove; becauſe all this while God is preparing the Soul for mercy, and that comfort that at preſent it feels the want of. You know in the exerciſe of Repentance, and humility, and a contrite and a broken Spirit, the Soul is not ſo ſenſible of the love of God; but the love of God then appears, though not in Spiritual comforts, yet in Spiritual graces; and after in reviving and quickening them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God ſometimes ſuſpends the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his love <hi>in the very graces</hi> of his People; but then it is <hi>not in theſe Graces that concern the ſafe being</hi> of his People; but in theſe graces that concern their <hi>well being.</hi> Gods People may be ſafe when they are not in ſuch a chearful and flouriſhing condition. For example: God may leave his People ſo far, as thattheir Faith (to wit of evidence) may be in the dark, their hope may be over-clonded, their joy may be eclipſed; it may be ſad with them, in reſpect of theſe kinds of graces at preſent. But as to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46197:206"/>their other graces that concern their ſafety, as humility, and dependance on God and ſome actings of Faith, theſe God keeps alive all this while.</p>
            <p>Again, all the withdrawings of Gods love from his People, the gradual withdrawings, as they are but gradual and partial, ſo they are <hi>but temporary</hi> and for a little time, Iſa. 54.7.8. <hi>For a ſmall moment have I for ſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my Face from thee, for a moment; but with everlasting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer.</hi> It was not total, it was but for a moment; it was not final, but with. everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee The darkeſt night with the People of God, ſhall have a bright morning. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and Joy for the upright in heart.</hi> Though it be as ſeed that is caſt into the ground: all the comforts of Gods People may ſeem to be as Seed caſt into the ground, which firſt dies before it lives; yet there will be a Reſurrection; it is but for a little time, that God deals ſo, that God withdraws thus gradually from his People, and that in theſe two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Gods <hi>withdrawing from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> he withdraws from them ſo as <hi>never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> I mean thoſe that are not his People, the wicked. Depart from me, and ſo depart from me, as everlaſtingly to depart from me. <hi>Depart from me into everlaſting burnings;</hi> this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting without returning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is but for a little time in reſpect of what the People of God <hi>themſelves deſerve.</hi> For there
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46197:207"/>is not the leaſt departure of ours from God, but it deſerves an everlaſting departure on Gods ſide from us. For us to leave him, to caſt off his yoke, to own any other Maſter, but him, deſerves that he ſhould utterly leave us.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, all theſe withdrawings and darknings, theſe gradual withdrawings of Gods love <hi>tends</hi> very <hi>much to the advantage</hi> of his People. If God withdraw his love in temporal bleſſings, it is that he may manifeſt more of his love in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mercies. If God take away from us a Creature comfort, he by this kind of Rod, ſhews us the neceſſity of living above our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and of living only upon himſelf. They are admirable deſigns, that God hath in theſe kind of ſeeming expreſſions of his diſpleaſure againſt us. He therein expreſſeth very much of love to us; his deſigns are gratious, partly to wean us from this world, by ſhewing us the vanity of it, and partly in giving us more of himſelf, and to let us ſee the need we ſtand in of him; and partly that we may have greater experience of his goodneſs, in his comforting ſupports under the greateſt burdens, that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us. Had not the People of God ſuch loſſes and croſſes and tryals in Creature comforts, they could never have taſted ſo much ſweetneſs in the promiſes, nor in the ſupports of the ſpirit, nor in the comforts of Gods preſence. but by Gods withdrawing, the gradual withdrawings of God as to his manifeſtations of his love in Spiritual bleſſings, God many times, does it, that they may not withdraw from him: He therefore hides away his Face, thereby to put them upon
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46197:207"/>ſeeking after him. We are apt to be very cold, and ſlight, and remiſs in the things of God, &amp; he to awaken us many times takes this courſe.</p>
            <p>Again, God ſometimes forſakes us in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comforts, that he may not forſake us in great, er bleſſiongs. Comfort is not at preſent, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as other bleſſings are. Mang may go mourning all the days of their lives, but if they go on in the way to Heaven, though they go mourning thither, one Minutes enjoyment of the glory of Heaven, will recompence for all. God doth it to enlarge their graces, and to fit them for greater comforts afterwards. The ſum of all under this head. as to the diſtinguiſhing love of God here ſpoken of, and the reallity of this love is, that though God doth not in the ſame height and degree manifeſt himſelf in his love to his People; yet nothing can ſeparate from the love of God. God may not manifeſt his love in that eminency, (as you have heard) yet there is nothing that can make a total, or final Separation from the love of God.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of this truth I ſhall give you ſome Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> Firſt from the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of Gods love free grace is the only Spring and Fountain, of all Gods love to his poor Creatures. If there be any thing of love in us to God, this cannot be the Cauſe, or Motive, of Gods love; in regard it is the effect, and fruit of antecedent love. This is clear; if there be any thing better in us then in others, it is becauſe God hath been better to us, then he hath been to others, and therefore the Apoſtle thus expoſtulates, 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>Who
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46197:208"/>maketh thee to differ, &amp;c. What haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe there is nothing of lovelineſs in us, but it is purely the freeneſs of Gods grace, that is the Motive of his love to us; this ſpeaks it an everlaſting love: and the force of the reaſon lies in this, becauſe if the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Motive of Gods love to us, had been any thing that he had diſcerned in us; then, as it was ſomething, that was pleaſing in us, that was the Motive of his love to us, ſo that which is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in us would put an end to his love. If our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did procure it, then our demerit would have forfeited it; and this alas we do every moment. But you find all along in Scripture, that it is the good will and pleaſure of God, to which all his love to us is aſcribed, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. <hi>Fear not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Flok, for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to you give the Kingdom.</hi> It is Gods good pleaſure, its not you have deſerv'd it, but he hath ſhewn you his goodneſs in being thus bountiful unto you, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing it upon you. So you have it very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>In whom we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi> It is grace, and riches of grace, that God ſhews any thing of love to us. So you have it ſeveral times men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in that Chapter. This is one Argument to prove the love of God to his People to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, becauſe it hath no other Foundation, nor Fountain, but his own goodneſs; his goodneſs is an everlaſting goodneſs, and therefore his love muſt be an everlaſting love. Was the Foundation of Gods love any thing in us, alas
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46197:208"/>we are mutable Creatures. You know in our Primitlve eſtate we loſt all; yea where we were in an eſtate of greater advantage, then we can ever arrive to here on earth; when we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of weakneſs, or ignorance, or corruption, but were fully furniſhed againſt all kind of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults; yet then barely the mutability of our will loſt all; but now the love of God doth not depend on the will of man, but the free grace and goodneſs of God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Faithfulneſs of Gods promiſes.</hi> God hath promiſed this, mark <hi>this</hi> is the ſum of all Gods promiſes, herein conſiſts the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Covenant of grace; it carries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingneſs and in diſoluableneſs in it. I will turn you to one or two places, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.3. <hi>The Lord hath appeared to me of old, ſaying, I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee with everlafling love: Therefore with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> Its called there an <hi>everlaſting</hi> love, and you find it promiſed likewiſe <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38. <hi>And they ſhall be my People and I will be their God,</hi> ver. 40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to dothem good.</hi> Do but obſerve, it is an everlaſting Covenant, and the promiſe of of this Covenant is this, <hi>I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> I will neither ceaſe to love them, nor ſhall they ceaſe to love me: God takes care of both parts. He hath promiſed for himſelf, that he will not, and he will ſo take care of them, that they ſhall not, ceaſe to love.</p>
            <pb n="360" facs="tcp:46197:209"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>immutability</hi> of Gods <hi>decrees.</hi> This ſhews the love of God to be ſo fixt, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, that nothing can ſeparate from it, or diſſolve. That God is the great Governour of all the world, and that all things are managed by his infinite Wiſdom, is acknowledged by all; and that he governs all things according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. This is the <hi>ldea,</hi> or Copy, of all that comes to paſs; this appears from the Eternity of God. God doth nothing now, but what he decreed in Eternity. Eternity is one point with God; there is no firſt, nor ſecond, nor laſt things with God. That theſe decrees with God are immutable, appears from the perfection of God: To take up new Councils argues imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. God loves none but thoſe whom he elected; and elected none, but thoſe whom he decreed to love. Now this Election is an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in God, for the glorifying the riches of his grace in ſome perſons, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks with that limitation: <hi>Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us unto the adoption of Children, according to the good pleaſure of his Will: To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the Beloved: In whom we have Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So that there is a particular defignation of theſe perſons to partake of this ſalvation, 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth thoſe that are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again Election includes in it thus much; a preparation, and ſanctification, of all means whereby thoſe perſons, that are deſigned to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhall infallibly be brought to it. God
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46197:209"/>doth not only deſign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to glory, as the end; but alſo to grace, as the means. And for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of grace in them, and for the preſerving of his People in a State of grace: God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for both. Now the fulneſs, and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of theſe decrees, argue the love of God to be unchangeable. As God hath intended ſome to glory as the end; he intended by grace as the means to bring them to that end, 2 Theſ. 2.13.14. <hi>But we are bound to give thanks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to God for you, Brethren, Beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation; through ſanctification of the Spirit &amp; belief of the Truth: whereunto he called you by our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> That is the glory purchaſed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And if this love of God flows from his electing decree, it muſt needs be everlaſting; becauſe God cannot be fruſtrated in his decre.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg. The fulneſs of that care that God takes</hi> of his People, though they may be tempted, and aſſaulted, and mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with ſore buffettings; yet he will not let them <hi>be tempted above what they are able.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13. and when they are the foreſt beſet with difficulties, and under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fears, and ſad thoughts; yet even then God hath the ſame care of them, that he had of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> That one expreſſion that we have, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. is enongh to clear this truth: <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> you read in the verſe before, of Gods reſerving of Heaven for them, and in this verſe of God's
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46197:210"/>preſerving of them for it, Though they may meet with many Rubs, and Interruptions in the way to Heaven, yet they are kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation; they ſhall not fall ſhort of glory; God doth ſtill love them, and they ſhall find the Fruit of this love to be everlaſting happineſs. His grace is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent grace, and therefore it is that our Saviour comforts his Diſciples. with this conſideration. Joh. 10.29. <hi>My Father is greater then all, and none can pluck you out of his hands.</hi> Now if God takes ſuch care of his People to preſerve them, then there is no fear of their falling ſhort of his glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> Laſtly, The <hi>many aſſurances</hi> that God hath given his People of his everlaſting love to them.</p>
            <p>He hath given them <hi>his word;</hi> he tells them <hi>whom he loves he loves to the end,</hi> Joh. 13.1: he hath told them, <hi>I well never leave you nor forſake you,</hi> Heb. 13.5.</p>
            <p>Nay he hath given them not only his word but his <hi>promiſe,</hi> which is more than a ſolemn word, Jer 32.40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from then to do them good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay he hath not only given them his promiſe but his promiſe <hi>confirmed with an Oath.</hi> Heb. 6.17.18. <hi>Wherein God willing more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew unto the Heirs of promiſe, the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Counſel, and confirmed it by an Oath: That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have a ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="363" facs="tcp:46197:210"/>
            <p>Nay he hath confirmed his Oath with a <hi>Seal,</hi> he hath given us his hand and Seal; and he hath given his People the <hi>firſt Fruits of the Spirit</hi> whereby they are <hi>Sealed up to the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So that you ſee the love of God hath this tranſcendent excellency in it. that it is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There is nothing, that enemies can do, to put a period to it; and there are all things in God, that might give us an aſſurance of theeverlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Now to make ſome Application of this point in a few words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This may <hi>inform</hi> us of the <hi>folly</hi> of them who <hi>fix upon any thing on this ſide God.</hi> There is no everlaſtingneſs, no fixation, no ſtability, in any thing, but in God only. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy Commandments are exceeding broad.</hi> Alas all other things are but as Clouds that are paſſing away; they are not: why ſhould we ſet our hearts upon things that are not? they are not becauſe they continue not. In fixing our hearts, and hopes, and in building our expectations, on any thing befides God, and placing our comforts on any thing beſides the love of God, as we highly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, ſo we highly wrong our own Souls.</p>
            <p>Hereby we highly <hi>diſhonour God,</hi> becauſe we prefer the Ciſtern before the Fountain; yea we rather chuſe to build on the Sand, then upon the Rock of Ages; we think our ſelves better in the hands of Creatures; then in the hands of the Almighty, and infinitely gracious God.</p>
            <pb n="364" facs="tcp:46197:211"/>
            <p>And we <hi>wrong our ſelves</hi> becauſe we bring our ſelves under an abſolute neceſſity of being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and diſappointed, though we may be as induſtrious as the laborious Bee, to wander from this to the other part of the world, to go to this, and that Flower; yet we are ſure to meet with nothing, but diſappointment, but God is a ſure refuge, his love is ſtable and ſecure to our Souls. Nay we do whtat we can to put God far from us, when we fly from him, and make the world our comfort. We bid as it were God to depart from us: We tell him we can do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without him; we can do well enough with other things besides him; we ſay as they did, depart from us, for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy love, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may <hi>inform us how</hi> ſuch Diſcourſes as this is, <hi>may cauſe our hearts to burn</hi> within us; as it is ſaid of his Diſciples, who were going to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus Christ</hi> appeared to them, and they knew him not, but afterwards when he had left them, then they recollected their thoughts, and ſaid <hi>How did our hearts burn within us whilſt he ſpake unto us?</hi> that God ſhould love ſuch as we are? and that with an everlaſting love? and ſo as that nothing ſhould be able to take off his love from us? not our ſins, not our provocations? this is a wonder. Though theſe may be as ſo many Clouds to darken his love yet this is a priviledge peculiar to all true and ſincere Believers. Now ſince God doth love us ſo wonderfully, how ſhould this cauſe our hearts to burn within us?</p>
            <p>To burn with the <hi>Fire of Repentance</hi> to purge away the droſs of our ſins, that ever we ſhould
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46197:211"/>be ſo fooliſh, unwiſe, and diſingenious, to requite ſo good a God who hath ſo loved us.</p>
            <p>And with the <hi>Fire of love;</hi> to love God, and to do what we can in acknowledging ſuch love in him to us. And with the <hi>Fire of Zeal</hi> for him, that hath ſhewed ſo much of kindneſs to, and care of and over us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> The next uſe is by way of <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in that I ſhall ſpeak to two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To them who find themſelves as yet <hi>Strangers to this love of God:</hi> Let me ſpeak to them. Oh do but think how ſad a condition you are at preſent! labour to affect through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your hearts with the ſadneſs of this condition; though you may have never ſo much of other Mercies, yet if you have not this Mercy; the ſingle want of this, is enough to imbitter the largeſt confluence of all your Creature enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is this alone that can bear up our Spirits while we live; and comfort our hearts when we dye, and it will go with us after death, and beyond the Grave. To want this, is to want that, which no orher enjoyent can make up; indeed, if we have the love of God, there is egough of the enjoyment of that, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſate the want of all things elſe! Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour firſt to be ſenſible of your condition, and to get your hearts affected with it, and then ſtand no longer capitulating with God, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Mercy, and that thankfully, upon, the terms that God offers Mercy. Is God willing to beſtow his love upon you? and is it ſuch a love that nothing can deprive you of it, when you
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46197:212"/>once have it? and is it a mercy that may be purchaſed on ſuch eaſie terms; And are you unwilling to accept it? Oh! <hi>It is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> Do not ſtand off longer; make no terms; raiſe no objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but come up to the terms which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. If it be to the <hi>cutting off a right hand,</hi> or <hi>plucking out a right Eye:</hi> And bleſs God that yo may be accepted on ſuch an account. Go to God and plead his Sons blood; and plead his Mercy; and though there is nothing in you to procure his love, yet make uſe of theſe things that may help you. Do not give over the uſe of means, but wait upon God in his Ordinances, that they may bring you over to partake of this love of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhor.</hi> To them <hi>whom God hath bleſſed with this love:</hi> I ſhall ſpeak one word to them. If God hath beſtowed on you this great favour, to own you, to love you, (to love you in and through Jeſus Chriſt) you have cauſe to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For God to love you, Truly it is a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing mercy; ſuch a mercy as God doth not vouchfafe to all. It is a free mercy; a mercy that God never beſtows upon any account, but only upon the account of his free grace. Now be thankful therefore, if you partake of the love of God, it is a mercy that but few fo his Creatures do partake of; and it is a mercy that any do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it. That God ſhould ſet his love upon fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man, and paſs by fallen Angels: That God ſhould ſet his love upon Creatures, it is much; but that he he ſhould ſet his love upon apoſtate Cratures; upon Creatures that are ſo much
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46197:212"/>below him, and upon ſinful Creatures, that ſo much provokt him, what cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs have we, that do partake of this love? but be careful, that you are upon a ſure Foundation. As to this, <hi>examine</hi> what is your love to God, his truth, his ways, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Again this mercy, is the ſum of all mercies: If God loves us (as one ſpeaks) then himſelf is our God; then all in God is ours; that is for our ſupport, and comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</p>
            <p>In the next place be <hi>careful to preſerve</hi> this love; be careful of doing any thing, that may cauſe God to withdraw any meaſure of his love from you, and make uſe of all kinds of means and helps, whereby you may have this love cleared, excited, and quickened; and upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very withdrawing of the love of God, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to recover it. Reſolve as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 132.3, 4, 5. <hi>Surely I will not come into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of my houſe, nor go up into my Bed, I will not give ſleep to my Eyes, nor ſlumber to my Eye lids, until I find out a place for the Lord, a habitation for the Mighty God of</hi> Jacob. Here was a great deal of earneſtneſs. So do you reſolve never to be at reſt nor quiet, until you have recovered what yo have loſt. We find that God does upon ſeveral accounts withdraw the manifeſtation of his love from his People: <hi>Sometimes to chaſtiſe</hi> them for their ſins; this was <hi>Davids</hi> Caſe; and if this be yours, then make <hi>Davids</hi> practice your patern: Be humble for your ſins; return to God, beg his Spirit to ſecure you againſt future Relapſes.</p>
            <pb n="368" facs="tcp:46197:213"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sometimes</hi> God doth <hi>it to try</hi> them: As this was the Caſe of <hi>job,</hi> and if this be your Caſe, Do as <hi>Job</hi> did when God ſeems to caſt you off follow God, and do not you caſt off him. God. (it may be) is trying your deſires to ſee whether you are willing to part with him or no: when he ſeems moſt in your apprehenſions to be neglectful of you, do you then labour to ſtir up Strongeſt after deſires him.</p>
            <p>Somtimes he withddraws his love <hi>when his</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>do not value it.</hi> As it was with the Spouſe: Chriſt withdrew, when the Spouſe was in Bed, and he knockt, and ſhe was willing to ariſe. If this be your Caſe, do you as the Spouſe did, be willing to riſe and ſeek him, till you find him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Be <hi>careful to improve</hi> this love of God, but how ſhall we do that?</p>
            <p>If you are ſure this priviledge belongs to you, then live up to this priviledge, live in contempt of things of this world: And make uſe of all thoſe things, that may quicken you in ways of obedience. God would not only have his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſerve him, but to ſerve him with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and becauſe his People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would not ſerve him with chearfulneſs in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all things, <hi>therefore he gave them up to ſerve their Enemies in nakedneſs, and hunger, and in the want of all things.</hi> Therefore be careful to make thankful returns of obedience to God, through the whole courſe of you Lives; and labour to bring others to partake of thoſe dainties, and refreſhments, that you have experienced, the ſweetneſs. But let me leave this with you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46197:213"/>you be not over haſty in thinking you are intituled to this priviledge, when indeed you are not; this is a great deluſion among Profeſſors there are many Profeſſors are yet rotten at the bottom; therefore look to your hearts: And if you have found upon examination that you have good grounds to hope, that you belong to God, and have an intereſt in his love, then live up to this Mercy.</p>

                  <p>Doct. 4. The principal Groun, and aſſurance which we have of the ſtabiltiy, and certainty of the love of God, to his People, is becauſe it is in and through Chriſt.</p>

            <p>THe love of God therefore moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears to be ſure, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, becauſe it is built on ſo ſure, and everlaſting Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine conſiſts of two Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What ever God hath of love to any of his People, it is only upon the account of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this love of God, through Chriſt to his People doth therefore appear to be certain, and unchangeable, permanent, and laſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in and through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What ever God hath of love to any of his People, it is only upon the account of Chriſt. Look upon common Mercies, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46197:214"/>you, that God ſupplies you, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for you; do you think there is any thing of worth, or deſert in you, that you enjoy ſo much of health, and ſo many outward comforts? it is not upon your own account, that God is thus bountiful; and yet we find, it was ſo much the folly of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they were ready to attribute all the Kindneſs of God, to ſomething or other in themſlves, and tehrefore it is that God himſelf is ſo often their Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer, and Monitour, to put them in mind, and to correct thoſe miſtakes, about his chooſing them to be his peculiar People, whom he owned above all the People in the World: Beſides, they were apt to think, that there was ſomething in them that might incline God to this kindneſs, no ſays God in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7,7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, becauſe ye were more in number then any People, but becauſe the Lord loved you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You may delude your ſelves with theſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but becauſe the Lord loved you, he choſe you, and he loved you becauſe he loved you: His love had no motive but what was from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no motive but only his own loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and goodneſs, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.22.23. <hi>Thereofe ſay unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord God, when he promiſed great Mercies to them, I do not this for your ſakes, oh Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but for my Holy Names ſake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The kindneſſeſs that God ſpeaks of there, are highly great, and yet not any of them were upon the account of any thing in them. And this it is really with us now, as in ſome few inſtances.</p>
            <pb n="372" facs="tcp:46197:215"/>
            <p n="1">1. Gods electing love, which is the firſt born of all Mercies, and the firſt link of that golden Chain, which you have in this very Chapt. 28.29. <hi>whom he did foreknow he alſo did p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>edestinat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This electing love, it hath its firſt riſe from the abſolute will of God, This is not the abſolute purchaſe of Chriſts merits, &amp; yet this is through Chriſt, in ſome ſenſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, that is in Christ;</hi> as in the verſe before, we are choſen in him; it is not ſaid for him, ſo that all the kindneſs that God hath for us, even this, which ſeems to be an Act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Freedom, and the moſt eminent expreſſion of Gods rich grace; That he ſhould chuſe, and and pick out ſome, and ſelect them from the common multitude of mankind, and to ſet them apart as ſpecial objects of his favour, (though this was from the abſolute will of God,) was in, and through Chriſt; if you ask how, I anſwer, we are choſen in him, not as the Foundation of our election, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are choſen in him for his Members, as He is our head; That this firſt love of God had ſome reference to Chriſt, though not as the onely procuring Cauſe, yet as the conſummating Cauſe to accompliſh, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly evident through the Scripture, we are elected in him, that is, that he ſhould perfect this bleſſed and gracious decree of God upon us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.11. <hi>According to the Eternal purpoſe which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> What purpoſe was this, it was a purpoſe to ſave ſome to ſet his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46197:215"/>Heart and love upon ſome, his electing love was thus far in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The love of Converſion, is in, and through Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,</hi> &amp;c. And though God is the ſufficient Cauſe, of all the grace we partake of; yet Chriſt is the meritorious Cauſe, it is the gift of God, and yet withal, it is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Chriſt; it is God alone that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows grace, and it is for the ſake of Chriſt alone that he doth beſtow it; compare thoſe two places. <hi>James</hi> 1.17. you read that <hi>God is the Father of Lights.</hi> But it comes all from God, in and through Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have Life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> God is willing to give it, but it is in and through Chriſt that he gives it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, to inſtance in the love of God in Juſtification; it is God alone forgives ſin, and our Saviour herein appears to be equal with the Father, becauſe he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all power into his hand, power to forgive ſins. Now as God onely can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſin, ſo it is onely for the ſake of his Son that he doth forgive it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> If God hath forgiven you, it is not for your own ſakes, but for the ſake of Chriſt, do you forgive one another, paſs by injuries, forgive offences, &amp; make this your pattern which is the higheſt pattern that ever was, or can be, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have Redemption
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46197:216"/>through his Blood even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> We have Redemption, and Forgiveneſs, but all come ſtreaming down in the Blood of Chriſt: In a word, to ſum up all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts of Gods diſtinguiſhing love, they are all in and through Chriſt, and therefore you read that Doxology, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi> He hath bleſſed us with the choiceſt bleſſings, but all theſe are in and through Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now give you ſome Arguments to prove it, and I ſhall only mention three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe God neither can, nor does love us as we are in our ſelves, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.17. <hi>And loe a Voyce from Heaven, ſaying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> It is not ſpoken of Gods love to him, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſpect, but of ſomething peculiar to him, and there is this double limitation as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters note, this is the Son of mine, whom I eminently love, and this is that Son of mine, for whoſe ſake I love the Sons of men; all do acknowledge that this love is a confined and limited love, that is ſpoken of here, but yet they explain it thus, <hi>My belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> That is, in whom I am eminently pleaſed, and for whoſe ſake I am pleaſed with them, whoſe cauſe he undertakes. As that Oyl that was powered on <hi>Aarons head,</hi> deſcended to the Skirts of his Garment, ſo that love that God hath to Jeſus Chriſt, deſcends to all
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46197:216"/>his inferiour Members, <hi>John</hi> 17.23, 26. <hi>I in them and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are high Expreſſions, and ſuch as exceed the capacity of all mortal men, that God ſhould love us with the ſame love, wherewith he loved his Son; The moſt ſober ſenſe by Interpreters, given of theſe words is this, That God in and through Chriſt, loves his People, for his ſake, with the ſame kind of love, though not with the ſome degree of love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>We are accepted in the Beloved,</hi> if God accepts of us, or ſmiles upon us, it is in and through Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf according to the good pleaſure of his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, God is ſo far from loving us, as we are in our ſelves, that he loaths us, for we are Enemies to him, and God is no Enemy to us. There be two notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>At that time ye were without Chriſt:</hi> what follows then, <hi>being Aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you are without Chriſt, you are without all good, for he is the Fountain of all good. Nay it is ſaid of the very Elect themſelves, 3. verſe of that Chapter, <hi>And were by nature Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath even as others.</hi> Ye were Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, though now you are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of love, you were as others, equal with others, as to original corruption, and guilt; original ſin, admits of no <hi>Magis</hi> nor <hi>Minus,</hi> it is not in one leſs, and in an other more,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46197:217"/>but it is alike in all: As to our natural ſtate, we are in the ſame Rank, and poſture with others; we are at the ſame diſtance from God, as the worſt of men that are in the World: Now conſider, in our natural ſtate how great a contrariety, and unſuitableneſs there is between the holy God and us, in our unholy eſtate; he is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all; we are darkneſs, and in us there is no light at all; in him there is nothing of evil; in us there is nothing of good, and what Communion can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch as are ſo perfectly contrary. While we remain out of Chriſt, our imbred corruptions have made ſuch a breach between God, and us, which is ever widening and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greater; though it was great at firſt, yet it is growing greater, and God is become our Enemy, and we are eſtranged from the life of God, by reaſon of the Multiplication of our actual ſins, renewed continually; and therefore God cannot love us as we are in our ſelves; nay he hates us, and accounts us Enemies, and he tells al ſuch what they muſt expect from him, if you walk contrary to me, I alſo will walk contrary to you, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. If you do carry it as Enemies to me, I will carry it as an Enemy to you; <hi>Do you provoke the Lord to anger, are you ſtronger then he?</hi> are you a fit Match, for the great God? Can your hearts endure, <hi>and your hands be made ſtrong, in the day that I ſhall deal with you?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="379" facs="tcp:46197:217"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Such is the love that God hath to Chriſt, that (how loath ſome ſoever we be in our ſelves) all is over lookt if we are in him, though we are unrighteous, but yet if we be in Chriſt he accounts us righteous, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt. He hath made him ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be the Righteouſneſs of God in him. He was made ſin,</hi> how? by <hi>imputation,</hi> and we are made the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, how? by way of <hi>imputation</hi> too, our ſins are charged upon him, and his righteouſneſs is imputed unto us; though we are of our ſelves <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous,</hi> yet by him we are made <hi>Righteous;</hi> therefore this is the Apoſtles advice, if you would take the moſt compendious way to anſwer all your doubts, and fears, and the ſpeedieſt courſe to be above all objections, the way is this, <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the Faith, know ye not your own ſelves, how that Chriſt is in you except ye be Reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 5 3.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſts being in us, and our being in him, are Terms equivalent: And if you can but clear this, that Chriſt is in you, all is well, and ſafe, and comfortable with you; but if Chriſt be not in you, you are in a ſtate of Reprobation, which is a moſt ſad, dreadful, and deſolate condition; and thus I have cleared the firſt part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Partic.</hi> Becauſe all the love that God hath to us, is in, and through Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46197:218"/>therefore this love of God is certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; it is indeed ſuch an Argument, as anſwers all Objections; we find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf, making uſe of this Argument, in the like Caſe, <hi>John</hi> 14.12. <hi>Becauſe I live you ſhall live alſo.</hi> Be not diſheartened, caſt down, and deſpondent, if I <hi>live,</hi> and that is ſure, and certain, ſo ſurely ſhall you live; if the head be above water, the Members cannot be drowned, though they be under water; if it go well with me, it cannot go much amiſs with you; Indeed, this would be a diminiſhing of the love of God to his Son, if his love to him did not extend to all that do bdlong to him. But where the force of this Argument lyeth, ſhall be diſcovered in theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe all that are Chriſts are made conformable to him, God loves his Son, becauſe he is the expreſs Image, and brightneſs of his own perſon. Now all that belong to Chriſt, have the Image of Chriſt upon them, and they partake of the ſame Spirit, 2 Corinth. 1.21. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> Whatever there is of grace, or goodneſs, or any ſpiritual Excellency in us, cannot be the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Gods love, but where God hath given ſuch pledges of love, they are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and an aſſurance of his further love.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As God hath a love to his Son, he muſt needs have a love to all Believers,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46197:218"/>becauſe of that near Relation that they ſtand in to him; they are Members of Chriſt, Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of Fleſh; Conſider thoſe Emblems by which the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Chriſt and Believers are ſet forth in Scripture, he is ſaid to be the Vine, and they the branches in this Vine: a Head, and they the Members under this Head; a Husband, and they the Spouſe. God hath ſuch an indeared love to his Son, that he cannot but have love to all thoſe that are ſo near and dear unto him; what can be nearer then to be a part of Chriſt; that is a high expreſſion that you have, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. they are ſaid to be the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> They are his body; if God loves his Son, who is the Head of this body, he muſt have a love to the Members alſo; they are his body, and the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all, that is all the Elect of God, as they are gathered in, ſo the body of Chriſt grows more compleat, and full.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe of Chriſts ingaging on their behalf, as their Mediatour, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this will appear in that Covenant of Redemption, that paſt between the Father, and the Son, as it is at large deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief: when thou ſhalt make his Soul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his Seed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="380" facs="tcp:46197:219"/>
            <p>Obſerve it, here are the Articles, and Conditions of this Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (the Covenant of grace is one thing, and the Covenant of Redemption is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Covenant of grace is that, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth between God and Believers through Chriſt; the Covenant of Redemption is made between God, and Chriſt) that, if Chriſt will condeſcend to become man, and undertake for the ſin of all his, and make ſatisfaction for thoſe ſins, the Lord was well pleaſed with theſe Conditions; it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he made his Soul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin; now all the recompence, and compenſation that Chriſt expects, looks, and did agree for, is to ſee of the travel of his Soul, and then he ſhould be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Oh how tender hath Chriſt been of your good; you would be happy if you were as tender of your ſelves; he was willing to leave all, and to undergo all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other account but this, (not that he ſhould be a gainer by you when he had finiſhed his courſe) in John 17.5. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth,</hi> &amp;c. One would think it was ſome greater glory that Chriſt expected, but all that he begs is this, with the glory I had with thee before the World was, he deſired no more, nor could have any more, becauſe that was ſo great, it could be no greater; now that Chriſt ſhould thus far ingage on the behalf of poor Creatures, this is a great ingagement to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46197:219"/>us, and in reſpect of the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was a great ingagement upon the Father, and this was that which paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; now that God that can do all things, who cannot lye, nor do any thing unbecoming his own Excellency, is a ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſtability of his love to Believers, this being his condition with Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe of the fulneſs of Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the meritoriouſneſs of what he hath done and ſuffered. There is not onely a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiency in the undertakings of Chriſt, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for all our Debts, to cancel all Scores, and acquit his People from all their guilt as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14, <hi>By once offering he hath perfected for ever, them that be be ſanctified. By once offering,</hi> the legal Sacrifices were often repeated, time after time, yes their moſt ſolemn Sacrifices had their Repetitions; theſe could not make the concerns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto perfect, but Chriſt by once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf hath paid all our Debts, and diſcharged us from the penalty our guilt expoſed us to.</p>
            <p>Again, as there is a ſufficiency in point of ſatisfaction, ſo there is a Redundancy in point of purchaſe; not onely a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to acquit them from all their guilt, but a Redundancy to intitle them to all the glory, and happineſs that they are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of.</p>
            <pb n="382" facs="tcp:46197:220"/>
            <p>Fithly, Becauſe of the conſtancy of Chriſts Interceſſion; he did not onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe all bleſſings when he was upon Earth; but by his Interceſſion, he is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that purchaſe, by ſpreading that Blood that he hath ſhed before his Father, and thereby procuring all the bleſſed effects of it to the benefit of his People, Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them. He ever lives and he ever lives to make interceſſion.</hi> This was an ordinary ſalutation, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> obſerves amongſt the Primitive Chriſti-when they met one another, <hi>The Lord is riſen;</hi>

The Interceſſion of Chriſt, muſt needs be of great force with God; our Saviour tells <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had told him his failings, <hi>Nevertheleſs I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not,</hi> and if I pray for thee, thou needeſt not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but to find the benefit of my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46197:220"/>that God that hears the cries of his poor weak People, hath promiſed that <hi>his Ear ſhall be open to the Prayers of the destitute, and therefore, he will hear their cries.</hi> Cau any imagine, but that this God <hi>who hears the cries of the Ravens,</hi> muſt needs have a high regard to the Prayers of his Son? this is the great advantage of all that are ſincere Believers, that they an Advocate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually praying, and interceding for them, at the Throne of grace.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Becauſe Chriſt by his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is continually making up thoſe freſh breaches, that our ſins are a new occaſioning, between God and us; there is nothing in all the World can ſeparate us from God, but onely ſin, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore all theſe inſtances that the Apoſtle gives here, of death, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, and Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can onely hurt us ſo far, as they may be occaſions of ſin; for nothing but this can do it; and there is none of the moſt eminent Believers, but they have their various ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful failings, which occaſion new breaches, But the love of God in Chriſt anſwer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all this too, <hi>if any man ſin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If we are offending, he is ſatisfying; If we are making God our Enemy, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46197:221"/>and making God our Friend.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Uſe by way Information.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It may inform us, what cauſe we have to bleſs God for Jeſus Chriſt; you ſee all depends upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, all our comforts here, and all ſafety hereafter, nay all our happineſs for ever; all depends upon Chriſt; Oh what cauſe have we then to bleſs God for him, he is the gift of God, that is the ſumme of all gifts, and the Fountain of all gifts, for what ever of kindneſs God hath for us, it is upon his account; now if God hath given us his Son, how ſhall he not with him give us all things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This may inform us, of the diſmal eſtate, of all thoſe perſons that are out of Chriſt, if God hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of love to poor Creatures, but what he hath in and through him, then certainly, he muſt have nothing but hatred, and indignation, againſt thoſe perſons that are out of him, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believes on his Son hath everlasting life.</hi> Everlaſting Life is begun in his Soul, he hath the firſt Fruits of it. <hi>But he that believer not is condemned already,</hi> &amp;c. That is the wrath of God is upon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46197:221"/>and while he continues in his unbelief, and it is like to abide on him ſtill. O what a wretched E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is every Unbeliever in, that place that was mentioned before, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Without Chriſt without Hope.</hi> If we are without Chriſt, we are without every thing of comfort; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſee what you are in your ſelves, where you are while Prayers, and endeavours may do you good, and while the Door of Mercy is open. Conſider what you are in your ſelves, and what you may be in him. There is love, and mercy, and all kinds of bleſſings to be had for you, if God accept of you, in and through Chriſt, but you can have nothing of love from God but onely in his beloved Son.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It informs us, what cauſe we have to be thankful to God that yet we have means, and helps for the getting of an intereſt in Chriſt. Though our intereſt in Chriſt be doubtful; and it is good to doubt that we may labour to be more ſure, yet what cauſe have we to be thankful that yet we enjoy the means of getting an intereſt in him; this is an incomparable mercy, all your hopes depend upon him; though it is not clear to you, that you can call him,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46197:222"/>yours, yet it is Mercy that you enjoy thoſe means by which he may become yours! Oh ſeriouſly improve theſe means, you know not how ſoon they may be taken from you, or you from them, be careful therefore <hi>to do the work of the day, while the day laſts, before the the night comes wherein no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Uſe. Is by way of caution take heed of ſlighting Chriſt, either in his Meſſengers, or Ordinances, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or in his truth, or wayes; you ſee if ever you do obtain any thing of favour from God, it muſt be only upon the account of Chriſt, and will you ſlight, or deſpiſe him, which you do, if you deſpiſe his Meſſengers, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that diſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me;</hi> or if you deſpiſe his Ordinances, and will not make uſe of them, you deſpiſe Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Make uſe of them you will ſay, you do make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>But you may deſpiſe them in the ſlight uſe of them, when every thing of the ordinance is over, as well as when the ordinance it ſelf is over, when you mind only the bare duty, and regard
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46197:222"/>not the conſequence, and Fruit of the duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Uſe. of Exhort. never reſt ſatisfied till you can clear up your intereſt in Chriſt, there was a ſtrange kind of diligence in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and a high kind of Zeal he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for God, when he would not recieve comfort, nor go up into his Bed, until he had provided a place for the Lord. Let the ſame Zeal appear in you, in the getting, and obtaining an intereſt in Chriſt. Oh never give your ſelves reſt, until you have ſome comfortable hope through grace, that it is well with you, and when you have obtained this intereſt. Labour to walk worthy of Chriſt, Oh be not you a reproach to that bleſſed name which you profeſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from Iniquity.</hi> Oh! have nothing to do with ſin, for theſe can be coupled together, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt and yet to go on in a courſe of ſin, is a contradiction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Uſe. Laſtly, This may be matter of unſpeakeable comfort to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that are clear in this great Priviledge, that they have a right and title to it, it is ſo ſure, and certain becauſe it is in and through Chriſt, that God loves them, though they may have failings, and weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46197:223"/>yet ſtill God loves them in Chriſt, as they are offending, ſo he is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of breaches; therefore build all your hopes, and expectations upon Chriſt, and labour to walk worthy of that encouragement which he vouchſafes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
